<h3><a name="Iirrationalityinargument">Wed 29 Aug 2007 : Iirrationality in argument</a></h3>
The truth is not found on the page, but is a wayward sprite that  
bursts forth from the readers mind for reasons of its own. I once  
thought that the Truth was a set comprised of all the things that  
were true, and the big truth could be obtained by taking all its  
component propositions and evaluating them until nothing remained. I  
would approach my rhetorical battles as a logical reductionist,  
tearing down, atomizing, proving, disproving, discarding falsehoods  
and reassembling truths until the Truth was pure, golden and  
unarguable. But then, when truth matters most, when truth is the  
agent of freedom, I stood before Justice and with truth, lost  
freedom. Here was something fantastical, unbelievable and impossible,  
you could prove that (A => B) and (B => C) and (C => D) and  (D => F)  
Justice would nod its head and agree, but then, when you turned to  
claim your coup de grace, A => F irrevocably, Justice would demur and  
revoke the axiom of transitivity, for Justice will not be told when F  
stands for freedom. Transitivity is evoked when Justice imagines F  
and finding the dream a pleasurable one sets about gathering cushions  
to prop up their slumber. Here then is the truth about the Truth; the  
Truth is not bridge, sturdy to every step, a marvel of bound planks  
and supports from the known into the unknown, but a surging sea of  
smashed wood, flotsam and drowning sailors. So first, always pick  
your poetic metaphor, to make the reader want to believe, then the  
facts, and -- miracle! -- transitivity will descend from heaven,  
invoked as justification for prejudice.
<p/>
Often we suffer to read, "But if we believe X then we'll have to...",  
or "If we believe X it will lead to...". This has no reflection on  
the veracity of X and so we see that outcomes are treated with more  
reverence than the Truth. It stings us, but natural selection has  
spun its ancestral yarns from physically realized outcomes, robustly  
eschewing the vapor thread of platonism as an abomination against the  
natural order, fit only for the gossip of monks and the page.
<p/>
Yet just as we feel all hope is lost and we sink back into the  
miasma, back to the shadow world of ghosts and gods, a miracle  
arises; everywhere before the direction of self interest is known,  
people yearn to see where its compass points and then they hunger for  
truth with passion and beauty and insight. He loves me. He loves me  
not. Here then is the truth to set them free. Free from the  
manipulations and constraints of the mendacious. Free to choose their  
path, free to remove the ring from their noses, free to look up into  
the infinite voids and choose wonder over whatever gets them though.  
And before this feeling to cast blessings on the profits and prophets  
of truth, on the liberators and martyrs of truth, on the Voltaires,  
Galileos, and Principias of truth, on the Gutenburgs, Marconis and  
Internets of truth, on those serial killers of delusion, those  
brutal, driven and obsessed miners of reality, smashing, smashing,  
smashing every rotten edifice until all is ruins and the seeds of the  
new.

Did I ever tell you about the time Nataliya took me out to go get a  
drink with her? We go off looking for a bar and we can't find one.  
Finally Nataliya takes me to a vacant lot and says, 'Here we are.' We  
sat there for a year and a half, until sure enough, someone  
constructs a bar around us. Well, the day they opened we ordered a  
shot, drank it, and then burned the place to the ground. Nataliya  
yelled over the roar of the flames, 'Always leave things the way you  
found 'em!'

<h3><a name="Everyoneandnoonewantstosavetheworld">Sat 16 Jun 2007 : Everyone and no one wants to save the world</a></h3>
When the world extended to one's surrounding hills and mountains and  
over them was only legend, saving the world was approchable and a  
natural activity to all of independent character.
<p/>
You do not need to justify the possession of these noble instincts.  
Such attributes are normally distributed. You have a constellation of  
these attributes and that makes you who you are. Recognise that the  
substantial ones are invariant.
<p/>
You must satisfy your invariant instincts or you will be at odds with  
your own character. It is only when we are not at odds with our basic  
makeup that we can find life meaningful.
<p/>
To exercise your instinct for saving the world, requires saving what  
you <i>perceive</i> to be the world.
<p/>
Being modern, educated and wordly, the world you perceive is immense  
and this is disempowering compared to the valley world of your  
ancestors where your feelings were forged and where saving 10 people  
saved 10% of the "world"'s population.
<p/>
Here lays the difficulty in actualising your character. Your  
perception is of a world so vast that that you can not envisage your  
actions making a meaningful difference.
<p/>
People try to fool themselves and others into believing that one can  
``think globally and act locally', however to anyone with a sense of  
proportion (not most people, btw) thinking globaly makes acting  
locally seem to be a marginal activity. It's not setting the world to  
rights.
<p/>
To meaningfully interact with the world, you have to either constrain  
your perception of what it is back to valley proportions by eschewing  
all global information (most of us here have engaged on just the  
opposite course which is what has provoked this discussion), losing  
your sense of perspective, or start seriously engaging with the  
modern perception of the world.
<p/>
That latter path can be hard to find, because it is only satisfied by  
creating ideas or inventions that have a global impact. Perhaps I  
have found one, and there's others out there, but for most people of  
your character a combination of eschewing knowledge of those parts of  
the world they can't change, and robust engagement with the parts  
they can is probably optimal.
<p/>
Do not be concerned about when one is to do good, who defines good,  
etc. Act in the way you do because to do otherwise would to be at  
odds would to be at odds with yourself. Being on a path true to your  
character carries with it a state of flow, where the thoughts about  
your next step come upon waking, unbidden, but welcome.
<p/>
I support similarly minded people, not because they are moral agents,  
but because they have common cause with my own feelings and dreams.

<h3><a name="TheUnitedwhatofAmerica?">Sat 09 Jun 2007 : The United what of America?</a></h3>

It has been frequently noted that many corporations exceed
nation states in GDP. It has been less frequently noted that some
also exceed them in population (employees).
<p/>
But it is odd that the comparison hasn't been taken further.
Since so many live in the state of the corporation, let us
take the comparison seriously and ask the following question. What
kind of states are giant corporations?
<p/>
In comparing countries, after the easy observations of population
size and GDP, it is usual to compare the system of government, the
major power groupings and the civic freedoms available to their
populations.
<p/>
The corporation as a nation state has the following properties:

<ul>
<li> Suffrage (the right to vote) does not exist except for land  
holders ("share holders") and even there voting power is in  
proportion to land ownership.
<li> All executive power flows from a central committee. Female  
representation is almost unknown.
<li> There is no division of powers. There is no forth estate. There  
are no juries and innocence is not presumed.
<li> Failure to submit to any order can result in instant exile.
<li> There is no freedom of speech. There is no right of  
association.  Love is forbidden without state approval.
<li> The economy is centrally planned.
<li>There is pervasive surveillance of movement and electronic  
communication.
<li>The society is heavily regulated and this regulation is  
enforced,  to the degree many employees are told when, where and how  
many times a day they can goto the toilet.
<li> There is almost no transparency and something like the FOIA is  
unimaginable.
<li>The state has one party. Opposition groups (unions) are banned,  
surveilled or marginalized whenever and wherever possible.
</ul>
<p/>
These large multinationals, despite having a GDP and population  
comparable to Belgium, Denmark or New Zealand have nothing like their  
quality of civic freedoms. Internally they mirror the most pernicious  
aspects of the 1960s Soviet. This even more striking when the  
civilising laws of region the company operates in are weak (e.g West  
Pupua or South Korea). There one can see the behavior of these new  
states clearly, unobscured by their surroundings.
<p/>
If small business and non-profits are eliminated from the US, then  
what's left? Some kind of federation of Communist states.
<p/>
A United Soviet of America.

<h3><a name="KurtVonnegutdies">Fri 13 Apr 2007 : Kurt Vonnegut dies</a></h3>
Kurt Vonnegut is dead.  A friend and iconoclast, he died last night  
aged 85. Vonnegut was the author of over 20 books, including  
"Slaughter House Five", written about his experiences as a PoW during  
the Dresden firebombing. On the night of the firebombing, 30,000  
civilians were burnt to death and most of Dresden's buildings were  
destroyed. Vonnegut hid with other PoWs in a slaughterhouse basement.
<p/>
Five years ago, I spent the winter exploring the former East German  
town. I learnt that Australian Army hiking boots are good to minus 7  
degrees, but at minus 8, heat flows out of the soles. I learnt that  
every major building in Dresden, from the Opera House to the Dresden  
Museum, was a socialist re-construction. I learnt that for even for a  
whole city the essential can be invisible to the eye.
<p/>
As a successful author Vonnegut sometimes pushed whimsy into self- 
indulgence, fueled by a cult following in the the youth movement of  
the United States, which, lacking other role models or serious tasks,  
anointed him a genius. Yet in "Slaughter House Five", this confidence  
and littery flexibility gave Vonnegut what he needed to reveal a  
major allied atrocity to a generation that  was sick of hearing  
stories about the war. This book seeded the belief system of a  
generation that would eventually react against similar atrocities  
inflicted on the Vietnamese.
<p/>
Here is part of an an excellent longer interview with Vonnegut on  
Australian Radio last year. Even in this fragment Kurt's acuity and  
character shine.

<p>
X is an "average shy intellectual" and in that is a sounding for  
characters of his type.
This type is often of a noble heart, wilted by fear of conflict with  
authority.
The power of their intellect and noble instincts may lead them to a  
courageous position,
where they see the need to take up arms, but their instinctive fear  
of authority
then motivates them to find rationalizations to avoid conflict.

<h3><a name="Carbonoffsetting">Mon 26 Feb 2007 : Carbon offsetting</a></h3>
<p/>
Green house legislation is the distillation of political forces  
marshaled by science, economic foresight, activism, paranoia, the  
desire for change, leadership, sycophantalism, pleasure in moral  
whipping, settling scores, conservatism and those psychological  
forces which drive them. But in some countries we may accept the  
legislation as a given and turn our eyes the phenomena which flows  
from it but whose path to the sea is not yet clear:
<p/>
In order to understand <i>carbon offsetting</i> we must first agree  
on what we accept for the sake of the argument. Here is a guess:
<p/>
1. global warming is a problem<br/>
2. atmospheric CO2 significantly contributes to gobal warming<br/>
3. a reduction in increase of atmospheric CO2 now significantly  
reduces the effects of global warming in a meaningful time frame<br/>
4. atmospheric CO2 levels are substantially under human control<br/>
5. of the CO2 production under human control a significant quantity  
comes from human enterprize<br/>
6. reducing CO2 production is a cost effective means of addressing  
global warming relative to other means<br/>
<p/>
I'm not sure I buy 6. but whatever. We are now tasked to reduce human  
emissions of CO2 although X
may claim that there's a 7. lurking -- the continued moral fibre of  
individuals in the body politic. That's a more difficult
question, which calls from great sympathy, but let us first work with  
what we can see clearly.
<p/>
We have only two questions (a) is carbon offsetting effective? and   
(b) is it efficient compared to the alternatives?
<p/>
Carbon offsetting by corporations is not motivated by moral  
considerations. It is motivated by legislation or
self-regulation backed up by the threat of legislation.
<p/>
It is effectively a tax on CO2 production, with the tax money going  
to industries that soak up carbon.
<p/>
Now here comes the realpolitik beauty of carbon offsetting. CO2  
producers favor it, since compared to
outright bans and limits, taxes have greater flexibility and  
predictability. Hence fearing the whip of
pending banning legislation, producers support this tax they would  
have normally hated. An increasingly
powerful industry lobby group is created by those who take CO2 and  
the middlemen who find them.
This lobby group is sees its interest as increasing the carbon  
transfer tax to the highest levels possible and to ferret
our deception by CO2 producers! As an industry, it is a far more  
stable influence that the vagarities of popular
political opinion. Even bureaucrats love it, as they now have their  
hands in another three industries.
<p/>
Hence this is an effective real politic way of introducing,  
sustaining and increasing a cabon tax that
would have great difficulties surviving as disconnected tax and grant  
system.
<p/>
That answers (a). (b) remains an interesting question, as does what a  
clever realpolitik  solution would
look like for funding those alternatives.
<p/>
If we have a serious problem, we are tasked to re-engineer the world  
using the best political, psychological and technological tricks we  
can come up with.

<h3><a name="Therightthingtodo">Mon 26 Feb 2007 : The right thing to do</a></h3>
People are motivated to follow happiness and flee from pain. These  
feelings *exist* to color our memories with our physiology so that we  
may extract meaning our experiences. It's a tautology to say that  
people do what makes them happy -- despite this, one often sees  
claims that there exist no altruistic acts, because such actions are  
the end product of people trying to maximize their happiness. This is  
to define aultrism out of existence, remove a useful word with which  
to partition our observations of reality. Instead, we may say that  
some people's happiness is bound up with other people's happiness and  
these people should be supported because of the obvious common cause  
with our own feelings.
<p>
A weaker form of the conservative argument (not mentioned here) is  
that a portion of seemly altruistic acts are covers for the fear  
associated with guilt.
<p>
When my eyes see phrases like 'right thing to do', 'appropriate' etc,  
I wonder what unstated world view I am meant to share. These phases  
smell of that unusually putrid whip; social sanction. But every man  
has experienced social sanction as the direct manifestation of morons  
baying at the moon, nodding and calling the result <i>consensus</i>.
<p>
Here, in Africa, there was a two page fold out on the "Night Runner"  
plague. Plague? Yes. Of people -- typically old, who supposedly run  
around naked at night (remember the population has   pitch black  
African skin tones), tapping on windows, throwing rocks on peoples  
roofs, snapping twigs, rustling grass, casting spells and getting  
lynched because it's "the right thing to do".
<p>
Insofar as we can affect the world, let it be to utterly eliminate  
guilt and fear as a motivator of man and replace it cell for cell  
with love for one another and the passion of creation.

Australia is a lagoon in a sea of english which, having no

blends into those that remain, until we no longer know whose thoughts  
we are.
<p/>
Industries can dump pig iron to crush foreign production and they can  
also dump words. Billions of these ideas, already produced for  
another english market and having no translation tarrifs or transport  
costs
slither into the country unheeded, stricken local journalists and set  
their burrows in our brains.

<h3><a name="Witnessing">Wed 03 Jan 2007 : Witnessing</a></h3>
<p/>
Every time we witness an injustice and do not act, we train our  
character to be passive in its presence and thereby eventually lose  
all ability to defend ourselves and those we love. In a modern  
economy it is impossible to seal oneself off from injustice.
<p/>
If we have brains or courage, then we are blessed and called on not  
to frit these qualities away, standing agape at the ideas of others,  
winning pissing contests, improving the efficiencies of the  
neocorporate state, or immersing ourselves in obscuranta, but rather  
to prove the vigor of our talents against the strongest opponents of  
love we can find.
<p/>
If we can only live once, then let it be a daring adventure that  
draws on all our powers. Let it be with similar types whos hearts and  
heads we may be proud of. Let our grandchildren delight to find the  
start of our stories in their ears but the endings all around in  
their wandering eyes.
<p/>
The whole universe or the structure that perceives it is a worthy  
opponent, but try as I may I can not escape the sound of suffering.  
Perhaps as an old man I will take great comfort in pottering around  
in a lab and gently talking to students in the summer evening and  
will accept suffering with insouciance. But not now; men in their

<h3><a name="Thenonlineareffectsofleaksonunjustsystemsofgovernance">Sun 31 Dec 2006 : The non linear effects of leaks on unjust systems of governance</a></h3>
You may want to read <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/ 
assange12052006.html">The Road to Hanoi</a> or <a  
href="conspiracies.pdf">Conspiracy as Governance</a> ; an obscure  
motivational document, almost useless in light of its  
decontextualization and perhaps even then. But if you read this  
latter document while thinking about how different structures of  
power are differentially affected by leaks (the defection of the  
inner to the outer) its motivations may become clearer.
<p/>
The more secretive or unjust  an organization is, the more leaks  
induce fear and paranoia in its leadership and planning coterie. This  
must result in minimization of efficient internal communications  
mechanisms (an increase in cognitive "secrecy tax") and consequent  
system-wide cognitive decline resulting in decreased ability to hold  
onto power as the environment demands adaption.
<p/>
Hence in a world where leaking is easy, secretive or unjust systems  
are nonlinearly hit relative to open, just systems. Since unjust  
systems, by their nature induce opponents, and in many places barely  
have the upper hand, mass leaking leaves them exquisitely vulnerable  
to those who seek to replace them with more open forms of governance.
<p/>
Only revealed injustice can be answered; for man to do anything  
intelligent he has to know what's actually going on.

<h3><a name="ThependingtotalannihilationoftheUSregimeinSomalia">Sun 24 Dec 2006 : The pending total annihilation of the US regime in Somalia</a></h3>
<p/>The US backed Somali "government", the Somali Transitional  
National Assembly (TNA), faces total annihilation, avoidable only by  
an Ethiopian invasion of Somalia and the creation of a Quisling regime.

<p/>

In the past year the TNA has been routed from all regions of Somalia  
by the Union of Islamic Courts (UIC) and now holds only Baidoa, a  
middling town close to the Ethiopian border. The "government" has  
already lost the capital, Mogadishu. The TNA is a US supported power  
broker club with many detested warlords, including those behind the  
1991 atrocities in <i>Black Hawk Down</i>. Its hold on Baidoa is weak  
and has only been maintained in the last 24 hours by aggressive  
Ethiopian air-strikes, artillery and the invasion of 10 to 20  
thousand Ethiopian troops. Ethiopia is the traditional, hated enemy  
of Somalis. Whatever legitimacy the TNA may have had with Somalias is  
now completely lost. The Molotov-Tribbentrop Pact is statesmanship  
compared to cynicism behind the TNA inviting Ethiopian troops and  
artillery into Somalia.

<p/>

It's worth pausing to reflect on the high power to wealth ratio of  
community building islamist movements such as the UIC when operating  
against well funded US/UN led democracy wagons. It appears the US   
promise of neocorporatism, i.e <i>better shopping</i> does not move  
the heart to engage in the cooperation, love and sacrifice demanded  
by war. The other US promise, <i>democracy</i>, is a difficult  
abstraction (try drawing it), and like all such abstractions, easily  
abused by those seeking power for other agendas. It is an alleged  
means to an end, not an end in itself. There's no human instinct for  
democracy.

<p/>

Consider the US Declaration of Independence (1776), a document which  
is the distillation of instinctive desires which drove men to war and  
kept them there. What are these desires?

<p/>

...God.. Creator.. created equal... Life, Liberty,... pursuit of  
Happiness.. Safety and Happiness... [followed by 26 paragraphs of  
hatred for the abuses of King George].

<p/>

<p/>

Not once does <i>better shopping</i> or its alleged antecedent  
<i>democracy</i> appear.

<p/>

This doesn't bode well for the Iraqi Provisional Authority or the  
Somali Transitional National Assembly -- at least, the British,  
pontificating and powdered though they may have been, shared the same  
language and religion.

<p/>

If the US administration wants to inspire Somalis and others to  
support its regimes, it'll have to do better than promises of  
<i>better shopping</i> and handwaving means into ends.

<pre>In a world with radio waves flowing all around, it should be possible  
for people's thoughts to be as
anonymous as the ether that caresses their skin.

I wrote the following (using ruby and the mDNS library). It's amusing  
and pleasing for wireless travel
or anonymity provided one has a domain name server somewhere. There  
are many situations where
DNS is available but not other types of routing (e.g Starbucks).  
Works under Unix and OS X.

<p/>
Something worth noting about the unusual relative power of community  
building islamist movements when operating against well funded US led  
democracy wagons as evidenced by the recent victories of the Somali  
UIC; the promise of better <i>shopping</i> does not move the heart to  
the great acts of love or sacrifice required in war. "Democracy" is a  
difficult abstraction that is easily abused (try drawing it). It is a  
means to an end, not the end itself. There's no instinctive desire  
for democracy. Consider the US Declaration of Independence (1776), a  
document which is the distillation of psychological forces which  
drove men to civil war and kept them there. What are those forces?
<p/>
...God.. Creator.. Men are created equal... Life, Liberty,... pursuit  
of Happiness.. Safety and Happiness... [followed by 26(!) paragraphs  
of hatred for the abuses of King George].
<p/>
In other words, religious feeling (x2), equality, life, liberty,  
happiness (x2),  safety and above all, an extreme hatred for the  
brutal acts, preferment, and corruption of foreign influenced or  
controlled government.
<p/>
Not once does <i>democracy</i> or <i>shopping</i> appear.

<h3><a name="Technologyvs.Psychology">Sat 16 Dec 2006 : Technology vs. Psychology</a></h3>
<p/>
My general feeling is little outright new technology is needed. What  
is needed is an ability to integrate what already exists with a  
subtle understanding of what the real, as opposed to perceived  
political constraints are and this is what some of us have done. A  
lot of people are attracted to technology because of their relative  
strengths in understanding spacial relationships compared to  
psychological relationships. Both types of understanding give them  
some power over their environment. However, when they become  
activists, this fear of the projected, but unreal political threats  
(of which legalities are a subset) lead them to solutions which do  
not reflect the way people actually behave. Likewise, those people  
who see everything only through the lens of politics are similarly  
blinded; since people's basic make up is invariant, changes in the  
way they behave arise from changes in physical reality.

<p/>
<quotation>
           Isaac's Question/Quest ("Behold the fire and the wood, but  
where is the lamb?" (Genesis 22: 7))
</quotation>
Which is lovely, since the open mind yearns to know what the question  
is as soon it hears the name, and a biblical character  may give  
christian sanctity (the answer to Isaaic is deeply moving, but the  
source of the pathos is horror. If we were to front as a Ploughshares  
style movement this might work).
<p/>
Isaiah has many questions, of which 6:10 seems to be the most  
interesting:
<p/>
<quotation>
           Isaiah 6:10-11 "10 Make the heart of this people fat, and  
make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they, seeing with  
their eyes, and hearing with their ears, and understanding with their  
heart, return, and be healed.'. Then said I: 'Lord, how long?' And He  
answered: 'Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses  
without man, and the land become utterly waste.

<h3><a name="Calibrationoffeeling">Tue 12 Dec 2006 : Calibration of feeling</a></h3>
<p/>
Words have no power to change except when there's a fork in the road  
with equally attractive paths.
<p/>
In your position, I'd take a deep book, a backpack of food and a tent  
and go walking for three months along the.au or .nz coast. You need  
to recalibrate your emotions through recalibrating your body.  
Emotions are body states. The mind can not be strong without strength  
in its relation to the body. 'Whatever' is then quickly answered;  
wake with the sun, take the next step, eat the next bite and behold  
people and chairs become a delight. It's hard for you to see this  
now, since future visions are colored with present emotional  
responses. But these emotional responses are just another part of  
your flesh, built from the integration of your neurons and body. It's  
material, stuff, like muscle, constructed from last weeks potatoes  
and environmental stimulus. You can strengthen your will through  
overcoming physical hardship.
<p/>
The natural environment provides man with ready motivational  
gradients, but civilization has filled them in. Hyper-civilized  
influences, such as computing, artificial lights, drugs, films,  
instant food supply, telephones and reading decalibrate by  
disconnecting behavior and  reward and failing to provide the sense  
data that our biological mental and physical structures have evolved  
to require.
<p/>
There's little difference between a mouse exploring a new maze or a  
scientist realizing the greatest intellectual act of the age. Both  
are motivated by the same primitive brain regions that control feelings.
<p/>
'The point' comes when feelings demand it. It can <i>only</i> be  
rationalized from the axioms of primitive emotion. If these axioms  
are weak due to decalibration by civilization, 'the point' eludes us.  
If they are strong, we pursue our goals with passion and vigor.

<h3><a name="Etymologyof'cad'">Mon 11 Dec 2006 : Etymology of 'cad'</a></h3>
<p/>
Caddie or cadet used to denote the passenger of a horse-coach picked
up for personal profit by the driver (i.e placed next to the driver  
and not in the already booked interior). So a 'cad' is a man who  
picks up women, profits from them, and
then leaves them by the road side. 'Caddie' or 'cad-et', as in the  
diminutive -- 'there goes a cad and his cadette'.
<p/>
Such romantic etymology is enough to make a man want to don his  
oilskin and mount
his horse with whip and smile at the ready.

<h3><a name="Selfdestructingpaper">Tue 05 Dec 2006 : Self destructing paper</a></h3>
<p/>
A spy opens an envelope. Inside is a thin sheet of paper with a  
cryptic message. After it is read the paper spontaneously bursts into  
flames.
<p/>
The message is the communicable distillation of your hopes, dreams  
and imagination. The paper is the internet. The internet is self  
destructing paper. A place where anything written is soon destroyed  
by rapacious competition and the only preservation is to forever copy  
writing from sheet to sheet faster than they can burn.
<p/>
If it's worth writing, it's worth keeping. If it can be kept, it  
might be worth writing. Would your store your brain in a startup  
company's vat? If you store your writing on a 3rd party site like  
blogger, livejournal or even on your own site, but in the complex  
format used by blog/wiki software de jour you will <i>lose it  
forever</i> as soon as hypersonic wings of internet labor flows  
direct people's energies elsewhere. For most information published on  
the internet, perhaps that is <i>not a moment to soon</i>, but how  
can the muse of originality soar when immolating transience brushes  
every feather?

Readers have asked what software is used to run IQ.ORG. A mere page  
of handwritten ruby constructs the site out the most robust future  
proof storage form imaginable. A flat directory of text or html  
files. The directory, like any directory can be backed up, edited,  
emailed, zipped, transported, printed, trapped in amber etc.
<p/>
A lovely way to create these files remotely is to send email to a  
mail alias. Add the following to your unix ".forward" file; it will  
save all email sent to as filed under the name of their subjects.  
Want to change something? Just mail it in again under the same subject!
<p/>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/ruby
# add this code to your .forward+secretname file like so:
# "|/home/me/public_html/iq.org/strew_incoming_mail.rb"
Dir.chdir(ENV['HOME'])
Dir.chdir('public_html/iq.org/strew') # change iq.org here to reflect  
your site's directory

s = $stdin.read
if /^Subject: ([^.\/].+?)\n/m =~ s
   subject = $1
   f = File.open(subject, "w")
   f.write(s)
   f.close
   Dir.chdir('..')

   exec "./index.rb > index.html"
end
</pre>
<p/>
Here is the code that scans the strew files and builds up the html  
output you see:
<p/>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/ruby
# save as index.rb
# puts "&lt;html>" etc here
strewdir="strew"
Dir.chdir strewdir
strews = `ls -t ???*`.map {|name| name.chomp}
strews.each { |name|
     File.open(name) { |f|
       linkname = URI.escape(name.gsub(/ /, ''))
       puts '&lt;h3>&lt;a name="' + linkname + '">' +  
f.stat.mtime.strftime("%a %d %h %Y") + ' : ' + name+ "&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>\n"
       s = f.read
       firstline = s.split(/\n/)[0]
       if firstline and /^(From |[A-Za-z_-]: )/m =~ firstline
         body = s.match(/\n\r?\n/m).post_match
       else
         body = s
       end
       x = body.scan(/--\{\s(.+?)\s\}--\s/m).join
       if x != ""

<h3><a name="TheRoadtoHanoi">Mon 04 Dec 2006 : The Road to Hanoi </a></h3>
<p/>
It seems like everyone I meet plans to follow the young Che Guavara,  
now that seduction of random latinos has been politically sanctified,  
and take off on their motorbike and adventure through the poverty and  
pleasures of South and Central America. And who can blame them? But  
there are other lands to explore.
<p/>
Last year I rode my motorcycle from Ho Chi Min City (Saigon) to  
Hanoi, up the highway that borders the South China Sea.
<p/>
On the road to Hanoi something caught my attention and that of every  
vehicle near me. We had to watch constantly and take action every few  
seconds or it would have killed us all.
<p/>
The road to Hanoi is a Vietnamese economic artery but is nonetheless  
dominated by potholes, thousands the size of bomb craters. There are  
constant reminders of "The American War" all over Vietnam, and  
perhaps this was one of them, but in a more indirect way.
<p/>
To a physicist a pothole has an interesting life. It starts out as a  
few loose stones. As wheels pass over, these stones grind together  
and against the under surface. Their edges are rounded off and the  
depression they are in also becomes rounder by their action. The  
stones become pestles to the hole's motor. Smaller stones and grit  
move between the spaces of larger stones and add to the grinding  
action. The hole enlarges, and deepens. Small stones are soon  
entirely worn away, but in the process liberate increasingly larger  
stones from the advancing edge of the hole. The increasing depth and  
surface capture more and more energy from passing wheels. The  
destruction of the road surface accelerates until the road is  
abandoned or the hole is filled.
<p/>
Road decay is, like a dental decay, a run away process. Utility  
rapidly diminishes and costs of repair accelerate, and just like teeth
it is more efficient to fill a pothole as soon as it is noticed.
<p/>
But this measure of efficiency is not the metric of politics and it  
is a political feedback process that lays behind the filling in of
potholes on almost every road on earth.
<p/>
That process is driven by the behavior of politically influential  
road users who are themselves motivated to action by psychologically
negative encounters with potholes.
<p/>
When potholes are small, the resulting political pressures are  
insufficient to overcome the forces of other interests groups who  
compete for labour and resources. Likewise, it is difficult to  
motivate people who have other passions and pains in their life to  
goto the
dentist when their teeth do not ache. Both are caused by limitations  
in knowledge and its distillation: foresight.
<p/>
Why is this surprising? It is surprising because we are used to  
looking at government spending through the lens of economic utility; a
lens which claims the political process as a derivative. This vision  
claims that political forces compete for access to the treasury to
further their own utility. Hence, military intelligence and public  
health compete with road maintenance for funding and so should  
attempt to minimize the latter's drain on the treasury. But that  
drain is minimized by filling in potholes immediately!
<p/>
Foresight requires trustworthy information about the current state of  
the world, cognitive ability to draw predictive inferences and enough  
economic and political stability to give them a meaningful home. It's  
not only in Vietnam where secrecy, malfeasance and unequal access  
have eaten into the first requirement of foresight ("truth and lots  
of it").
<p/>
Foresight can produce outcomes that leave all major interests groups  
better off. Likewise the lack of it, or doing the dumb thing, can
harm almost everyone.
<p/>
Computer scientists have long had a great phrase for the dependency  
of foresight on trustworthy information; "garbage in, garbage out".
In intelligence agency oversight we have "The Black Budget blues",  
but the phrase is probably most familiar to American readers as "The  
Fox News Effect".

<p/>I was travelling across a golden meadow when I encountered the tiger. I fled, with the tiger close behind.
<p/>
Coming to a precipice, I caught hold of a wild vine and swung myself over the edge. The tiger sniffed my scent above. 
<p/>
Trembling, I looked down to the beach far below and saw a second tiger pacing the sands. Only the vine sustained me. 
<p/>
Two mice, one black and one white, came out of a crevice and started to gnaw away at the vine.
<p/>
I saw a luscious strawberry nearby. Grasping the vine with one hand I picked it with the other. How sweet it tasted!

If you saw two bodies entwirled in the dance

Bound to each other with effortless grace, 
<BR>
Joyous, momentous, elliptical grace! 
<BR>
They whirled through the ether, in delicate spirals, 
<BR>
For eons they danced, until in the blink 
<BR>
Of proverbial eyes, one crossed o'er the brink: 
<BR>
One caught a cancer, and started to brew 
<BR>
And choke and ferment and splutter and spew, 
<BR>
Find itself overtaken, cauterised, bled, 
<BR>
Starved, smothered, covered in rash 
<BR>
Wheezing away, overheated with fever 
<BR>
Till it could dance no more, it could not keep step 
<BR>
As it coughed up its blood, and collapsed in a spasm, 
<BR>
And cancer descended on dancers romancing 
<BR>
The universe, and time; and life, in time, 
<BR>
Till the life turned malignant and tripped up the dance:

And the clouds cleared away, and all of the people --

Not just your people! -- not just my people! -- but

Mothers with children, and fathers with children,

And wizened old voices, and laughter and stories 
<BR>
And wisdom and knowledge, and questions and reason 
<BR>
And passion and folly and crying and love, 
<BR>
Not just the past, not just hundreds thousands, 
<BR>
But hundreds of thousands and millions years on! --

Millions years more of those yet to appear,

In full expectation of their turn to be,

Save yourselves, some said! Be ye saved, some said!

Sieg heil, some said! Fight a war, some said! 
<BR>
Hold the line, some said! Tow the line, some did. 
<BR>
But for the most part -- and for the best part! -- 
<BR>
The ordinary people, not -ese and not -ism, 
<BR>
They stood there and shrugged -- I'm just a human! -- 
<BR>
And spilled over borders, and greeted their neighbours, 
<BR>
And played with their children, and looked to the future, 
<BR>
And cared not for great things, but just to continue; 
<BR>
Not for them all of these overblown trumpets! 
<BR>
The best part said nothing, and wandered, confused, 
<BR>
Staggering now, they tottered unsteady, 
<BR>
As if the earth lurched, besmirched by their industry, 
<BR>
As if the earth's spasm had shaken them too, 
<BR>
Robbed of their pleasantries, certain no more, 
<BR>
Oh there was more -- oh there was more! -- 
<BR>
To life in this world than cheap petrol prices! 
<BR>
Again insignificant, floating in space, 
<BR>
Without direction -- there's no up in space! -- 
<BR>
Roused from conformity, forced into puberty, 
<BR>
Silenced by grim revelation of wrongs, 
<BR>
This planet is only a miniature starship! 
<BR>
Swiftly reverted to innocence lost, 
<BR>
So eager to reclaim the goodwill they'd lost! 
<BR>
All of them! -- All of them! -- All of the people 
<BR>
That ever, and always, and now and forever 
<BR>
Will ever have been and will ever have lived! -- 
<BR>
The whole civilization, pre-civilization, 
<BR>
Post-civilization, ancient and modern, 
<BR>
Post-modern to present and all that's to come, 
<BR>
Entire human project, evolutionary epic, 
<BR>
Thirteen thousand million years long in the making, 
<BR>
In all of their habits, their rituals and fears, 
<BR>
The whole of the species paraded before you, 
<BR>
Put on their best faces and virtues and smiles, 
<BR>
Turned out for the moment, for this one occasion, 
<BR>
And played, and laughed, and studied, and shook 
<BR>
Each others hands, and their heads, and remembered nostalgia, 
<BR>
They crammed on the land mass -- they jammed all the land mass! -- 
<BR>
And Europe grew warm, and Africa thundered, 
<BR>
And Asia flowed over, and Australia sweltered, 
<BR>
And America repented, Antarctica melted, 
<BR>
From the weight of the gathering -- reunion -- preunion! -- 
<BR>
The party had gathered, the crew had been summoned, 
<BR>
And filled all the islands with shocks of bright vestments, 
<BR>
The ship filled with passengers, decks cleared for the crush, 
<BR>
The siren had sounded, the islands had foundered 
<BR>
As ships on an orb that, deluged and flooded, 
<BR>
Threatened to sink those few vessels remaining. 
<BR>
So stood the humans, so stood the proud 
<BR>
And the humble, the paragons of animals -- sometimes! -- 
<BR>
Packed on to continents, over the globe! 
<BR>
The clouds cleared away and the crowds turned away 
<BR>
From the ground, and looked up, at the skies there above -- 
<BR>
Like spokes on a wheel, a luminous wet sphere, 
<BR>
Like floodlights ascending to heaven from home, 
<BR>
Like cancerous cells of a terminal tumour, 
<BR>
Beautiful, innocent, terminal tumour, 
<BR>
Their eyes pierced the void and looked into the cavity 
<BR>
To broadcast their tragedy out to the world, 
<BR>
And half saw the stars, saw an infinite blackness, 
<BR>
Saw the coldness and loneliness, nebular nothingness, 
<BR>
Themselves at the helm of a ship in deep space, 
<BR>
But bound to observe from the terrestrial observatory, 
<BR>
Observed the distance -- and gave up on escape! -- 
<BR>
Saw the world as it is, there would be no saviour, 
<BR>
They'd grown -- how they'd grown! -- and outgrown their mother, 
<BR>
Couldn't quite yet leave home, but yet it was time: 
<BR>
Grow up now children, stand on your own feet! 
<BR>
The dreamers still dreamed of a yet better world, 
<BR>
The couples still kissed and the dispossessed smiled, 
<BR>
But the lonely found loneliness appeased their loneliness 
<BR>
As their neighbours all huddled to fight off the chill 
<BR>
Of the universe -- they drank, to the meaning of it all! 
<BR>
And from their huddle, while the void loomed above, 
<BR>
Declared -- Brother and Sister! 
<BR>
  -- <SPAN  CLASS="textit">if we should survive</SPAN>, 
<BR>
And, surveying the scene, realising what that meant, 
<BR>
Then -- and then they broke off, and left it unsaid 
<BR>
And again shook their heads, and wept, 
<BR>
 -- <SPAN  CLASS="textit">never again!</SPAN> 
<BR>
The other half saw blue sky, and warmth -- <SPAN  CLASS="textit">unseasonable</SPAN> warmth -- 
<BR>
And celebrated the day, gave thanks for the day, 
<BR>
Seized hold of the day and seized hold of the life 
<BR>
And seized hold of each other, looked out to the blue, 
<BR>
And wished that it would never end. 
<BR>


<P>
If you saw two bodies entwirled in the dance 
<BR>
Bound to each other with effortless grace, 
<BR>
Joyous, momentous, elliptical grace! 
<BR>
They whirled through the ether, in delicate spirals, 
<BR>
One was all gold, and one was all blue -- 
<BR>
But not yet all blue -- for marooned in the sea 
<BR>
Were the islands that founder, with inhabitants that flounder, 
<BR>
But for you they came out, all of the people 
<BR>
That ever, and always, and now and forever 
<BR>
Will ever have been and will ever have lived! 
<BR>
And you did not see green or brown 'twixt the seas, 
<BR>
But all of the people: all of the whole 
<BR>
Conurbation, the cities, the landscapes of faces, 
<BR>
All staring out, all through the dance, 
<BR>
The whole human family, whole human endeavour, 
<BR>
Staring out, eyes wide open, hopeful and afraid, 
<BR>
Knew what you'd done, knew that the dancer 
<BR>
Was slowing and coughing and covered in rash, 
<BR>
As cancer descended on dancers romancing 
<BR>
As the vastness descended on all of the people 
<BR>
Of what they had done to their dear mother earth, 
<BR>
Pock-marked and bleeding, suffocating and searing, 
<BR>
You saw all these faces and eyes and bright places, 
<BR>
The universe, and time, and one poor tragic planet: 
<BR>
What would you do if the cancer was you? 
<BR>


<P>
And if you could see -- if you can bear with me! -- 
<BR>
If you could see all of the faces before you, 
<BR>
If you could look into their full expectation, 
<BR>
Knowing that you were part of the problem, 
<BR>
Knowing that all of us hurtle to death: 
<BR>
Personal death, planetary death, 
<BR>
All of the people -- yes all of the people! -- 
<BR>
And didn't do nothing, did not stay the course, 
<BR>
Did not shy away, did not run away, 
<BR>
There's nowhere to run from this speck in the universe, 
<BR>
But helped turn the tide -- helped them to survive -- 
<BR>
Then you, my friend, deserve to be human. 
<BR>

<h3><a name="AjitaKesakambala(earlyIndianmaterialism)">Tue 26 Sep 2006 : Ajita Kesakambala (early Indian materialism)</a></h3>
The buddhist text <i>Digha Nikaya</i> (Samannaphala Sutta, the fruits  
of the contemplative life) has dialogs with six post <i>Upanished</i>  
radical thinkers who wandered North India around the time of the  
Buddha's birth (circa 500 BCE) provoking debate and attracting  
followers. Of them the most interesting and clearly the most radical  
is <i>Ajita Kesakambala</i>. Ajita was a contemporary of Siddhartha  
Gautama (the Buddah) with a rival materialistic school. Ajita's  
philosophy was atheistic and even denied transmigration. Ajitas  
acerbic vision probably flowered and was repressed for the same  
reason; it offered complete mental liberation to those to those  
enslaved by the kamma yolk of the Brahmin. Since the Digha Nikava is  
a buddhist text following a long oral tradition it is likely Ajita's  
position has been extremised to nihilism inorder to give Buddhism the  
middle. Indian Buddhism was a radical shift away from Hindu  
traditions and undermining of Brahmin power, but thanks to Ajita and  
other radicals still successfully pushed as <i>The Middle Way</i>.

<blockquote>

"Another time I approached Ajita Kesakambala and, on arrival,  
exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly  
greetings and courtesies, I sat down to one side. As I was sitting  
there I asked him: 'Venerable Ajita, there are these common  
craftsmen...They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the  
here and now...Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar  
fruit of the contemplative life, visible in there here and now?'

"When this was said, Ajita Kesakambala said to me, 'Great king, there  
is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed. There is no  
fruit or result of good or bad actions. There is no this world, no  
next world, no mother, no father, no spontaneously reborn beings; no  
priests or contemplatives who, faring rightly and practicing rightly,  
proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and  
realized it for themselves. A person is a composite of four primary  
elements. At death, the earth (in the body) returns to and merges  
with the (external) earth-substance. The fire returns to and merges  
with the external fire-substance. The liquid returns to and merges  
with the external liquid-substance. The wind returns to and merges  
with the external wind-substance. The sense-faculties scatter into  
space. Four men, with the bier as the fifth, carry the corpse. Its  
eulogies are sounded only as far as the charnel ground. The bones  
turn pigeon-colored. The offerings end in ashes. Generosity is taught  
by idiots. The words of those who speak of existence after death are  
false, empty chatter. With the break-up of the body, the wise and the  
foolish alike are annihilated, destroyed. They do not exist after  
death.'

"Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible  
here and now, Ajita Kesakambala answered with annihilation. Just as  
if a person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a  
breadfruit; or, when asked about a breadfruit, were to answer with a  
mango. In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative  
life, visible here and now, Ajita Kesakambala answered with  
annihilation. The thought occurred to me: 'How can anyone like me  
think of disparaging a priest or contemplative living in his realm?'  
Yet I neither delighted in Ajita Kesakambala's words nor did I  
protest against them. Neither delighting nor protesting, I was  
dissatisfied. Without expressing dissatisfaction, without accepting  
his teaching, without adopting it, I got up from my seat and left.

<h3><a name="Thecuriousworldofthequerulous">Tue 26 Sep 2006 : The curious world of the querulous</a></h3>
You quote Dickens, but if one must resort to fictional antecedents of
querulous litigants and their courts, then Franz Kafka's <i>The
Trial</i> is
surely <i>the</i> book:
<blockquote>
"The Great lawyers?" asked K. "Who are they then? How do you contact
them?" "You've never heard about them, then?" said the litigant.
"There's hardly anyone who's been accused who doesn't spend a lot of
time dreaming about the Great lawyers once he's heard about them. It's
best if you don't let yourself be misled in that way. I don't know
who the Great lawyers are, and there's probably no way of contacting
them. I don't know of any case I can talk about with certainty where
they've taken any part. They do defend a lot of people, but you can't
get hold of them by your own efforts, they only defend those who they
want to defend.
</blockquote>
<p/>
One of my Great Lawyers was <a href="http://www.farisqc.com/">Peter
Faris QC</a>, originally a left wing radical defender of drug barons,
but then recently resigned has head of National Crime Authority under
ALP appointment. He later aligned his personal and political life after
becoming a prosecutor and is now a right wing demagogue of the first
order. Last year in <i>The Age</i> he demanded the removal of St.
Kilda's street prostitutes. Not for Faris the pacing feet of these poor
Melbourne Magdelenes. But here is a man who resigned from the NCA in
quiet disgrace after the Victorian police caught him visiting a brothel
and using the NCA to cover it up. What are we to infer? Faris supports
small business but is opposed to independent contracting?
<p/>
Your paper under-estimates the consuming nature of litigation.
Most intelligent litigants learn the language of the courts in their
struggle to understand and control the new environment in which they
find themselves. Those with good social as opposed to merely verbal
cognition find soon enough that the judiciary and court administration,
while accepting this language from its gowned courtiers and other
hangers-on do not like to hear their ritual language flowing from the  
mouths and
pens of uninitiated peasants. Cunning actors against the state  
develop a faux naivity
to their pleadings or find a wig to sanctify them.
<p/>
Anyone afflicted with servants of justice will soon find
themselves exposed to all manner of hypocracy, mendacity and
incompetence. If one is foolish enough to demand fair redress for every
new insult then it's possible to create a never-ending supply of
injustice and so, in this manner, turn a small injustice into an
injustice of unbound size. One must develop a certain cynical
understanding that systems of people are careers and intrigues and
necessary deceptions and that kind acts fall from the breasts of stray
individuals as random acts of love and can not be systematized.
<p/>
The litigants I encountered to seemed to have
an interesting commonality above the paranoia and rigidity you document.
They made many contacts with people in positions of power and status
compared to their station in life. This seems to become the central
status mechanism of their life and the vision of their litigation ending
does not bring them relief but feelings of exclusion perhaps exacerbated
by the collapse in their other relationships. They look to increase
their self-perceived status by seeking precedent setting judgements in
ever higher courts with higher status legal teams and defeating ever
more powerful enemies in legal combat. Yet with the change of a single
word we can remove the pathology:
<blockquote>
Lawyers look to increase their self-perceived status by seeking
precedent setting judgements in ever higher courts with higher status
legal teams and defeating ever more powerful enemies in legal combat.
</blockquote>
<p/>
In your paper you mentioned the declining number of
vexatious litigants and attributed this to the growth of complaint
resolution proceedurs which provide the querulous with alternate avenues
to litigation. Consider this
question. Has the rise in educational opportunities over the past 20  
years and the resulting 
class transfer provided an alternative power mechanism for the
hyper verbal?
Where have all the union firebrands gone? Together, perhaps with  
the pre-vexatious, they are
being honed by tertiary education into efficient cogs for the neo- 
corporate state and
in their spare time Adapting <i>Waiting for Godot</i> for the  
university <i>Law Review</i>.
<p/>
The querleous derived from working
class, underclass or lower middle class families and were all shorter
and less educated than their intelligence would normally reflect. These
guys delighted in beating the silver spoon set at their own game. One  
changed his surname to "President" to the mute horror of
the judiciary who were then forced to utter the status transferring  
appellation "Mr. President" at least once in any proceeding he was a  
party to.
<p/>
Although this last example is rather extreme, I felt amusement and pride at
seeing Dr. Blow and other bedfellows of injustice flail under
my crossexamination so that despite my very young age lawyers filed  
in to watch and make statements like "that's the last
court report gig that witness will ever get from here!". If it wasn't  
for
the fact that I had a lot to lose and had already felt substantial power
over the establishment in another world, I may have found solace in
following the path of Mr. President who had nothing to loose since his
case was in a culdesac more typical of <i>The Trial</i>.
<p/>
Certainly at the time I didn't see his name name as pathological, but
rather a delightful, spirited, if tactically unwise, prank on those self-righteous
throned and frequently incompetent pontificators whom I did not respect,
but to who I was forced to sit, stand, bow, scrape and utter a raft of
honorifics and ego-salving platitudes because despite their many
grandiloquent claims of impartiality and gravitas, experience had shown
they were sensitive souls and easily biased against those who were not
first rate sycophantic grovelers.
<p/>
Perhaps it is this behavior combined with distal remnants of Arthurian
code that is the source of the the well reported bias of the  
judiciary against male litigants in person. A judge doesn't need to  
bring a woman to heel, she is, after all not a threat, but a lovely  
object of desire or irrelevance, but any man worthy of
the label rebells at such enforced kowtowing with his posture  
and tone and
so must be ground down less gowned courtiers see the weakening king and boldly
make their move.

<h3><a name="TheDefiledSanctuary">Tue 26 Sep 2006 : The Defiled Sanctuary</a></h3>
<p/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">Bertrand  
Russell</a> introduced the second volume of his autobiographical work  
with the following:
<blockquote>
I saw a chapel all of gold that none did dare to enter in, and many  
weeping aloud without, weeping, mourning, worshipping.
I saw a serpent rise between the white pillars of the door, and he  
forced and forced and forced, till down the golden hinges tore;
And along the pavement sweet set with pearls and rubies bright, all  
his shining length he drew, -- till upon the altar white,
vomited his poison out on the bread and on the wine. So I ran into a  
sty, and laid me down among the swine. <b>W. Blake</b>, <i>The  
Defiled Sanctuary</i>
</blockquote>
<p/>
<a href="http://iq.org/">IQ.ORG</a> also used this quote, till  
discovering it in Russell. This seems to be one of Blake's least  
popular poems, but like many of his later less lyrical works has  
strength in the darkness of the vision. One can see how Blake's  
insight here resonated with Russell's desired self perception. But  
what if Russell not only flees from desecration revealed but is the  
dramatic figure of causation and revelation? Russell is the actor of  
change. Russell is the serpent and vomiting out his poison into the  
transubstantiated body of Christ, an interpretation that would have  
pleased both Russell and his enemies in the British and American  
theocracies. Now I say unto you -- arise serpents! Tear the hinges  
from their doors, stand above the alter white and vomit out your  
poison till deceit crumbles and sets free the dove.

<h3><a name="Whataretheoriginsofhacktivism?">Sat 23 Sep 2006 : What are the origins of hacktivism?</a></h3>
<pre>Real hacktivism is at least as old as October 1989 when DOE (US  
Deptartment of Energy) HEPNET and SPAN (NASA) connected VMS machines world
wide were penetrated by the anti-nuclear WANK worm, which changed the  
system announcement banner to be:

         W O R M S A G A I N S T N U C L E A R K I L L E R S
       _______________________________________________________________
       \__ ____________ _____ ________ ____ ____ __ _____/

            \___________________________________________________/
             \ /
              \ Your System Has Been Officically WANKed /
               \_____________________________________________/

        You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war.

In our book, Suelette Dreyfus and I track the source of the worm to
Melbourne, Australia. At the time there was considerable anti-nuclear
sentiment in the country. Australia had (and still has) a number of US
spy, early warning and nuclear submarine communications bases, most of
which were first and second strike soviet targets (Australia would not
otherwise be a nuclear target).

Additionally in 1984, New Zealand, a country with which Australians
feel a special affinity, had under Labour pri-minister David Lange,
made NZ a nuclear free territory, precluding the admission of nuclear
armed or powered warships into NZ ports. The US in response rescinded
its defence treaty obligations to NZ, cut intelligence ties (or at
least pretended to, see Nicky Hager's excellent book ``Secret Power''
for futher details) and instigated a number of trade sanctions against
the country.

But New Zealand's nuclear woes were not to end there. At 11:59pm on
the night of July 10 1985 the Greenpeace flag-ship ``Rainbow
Warrior'', docked in Auckland harbour preparing to sail in three days
time to Mururoa Atoll to demonstrate against French nuclear tests, was
blown up by amphibious DGSE (French Secret Service) agents, killing
Greenpeace photographer Fernando Pereira. Within days, two DGSE agents
Alain Mafart and Dominique Prieur were arrested, following an
investigation by Australian journalist Chris Masters, plead guilty to
manslaughter and were sentenced by the NZ high court to 10 years. The
other DGSE agents escaped via a French Nuclear sub off the NZ
coast. The French, a significant NZ trade partner, immediately
instigated trade sanctions against the country. In June 1986, a
political deal was struck; France would lift sanctions, pay a few
million in blood money, and the two agents would be transferred to Hao
Atoll, a French military base in the pacific, where they would
supposably serve out the remainder of their sentences. However, by May
1988 both had been smuggled back to France.

Examination of the worm source code show specific instructions
to avoid infecting New Zealand.

Policy has unintended consequences but it should be remembered
that some are blessings. So, go boldly and change!

<h3><a name="WilliamJamesSidis">Sat 23 Sep 2006 : William James Sidis</a></h3>
               <P>His
                 name was William James Sidis, and his IQ was  
estimated at between
                 250 and 300 [8, p. 283]. At eighteen months he could  
read The
                 New York Times, at two he taught himself Latin, at  
three he learned
                 Greek. By the time he was an adult he could speak  
more than forty
                 languages and dialects. He gained entrance to  
Harvard at eleven,
                 and gave a lecture on four-dimensional bodies to the  
Harvard Mathematical
                 Club his first year. He graduated cum laude at  
sixteen, and became
                 the youngest professor in history. He deduced the  
possibility
                 of black holes more than twenty years before  
Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar
                 published An Introduction to the Study of Stellar  
Structure. His
                 life held possibilities for achievement that few  
people can imagine.
                 Of all the prodigies for which there are records,  
his was probably
                 the most powerful intellect of all. And yet it all  
came to nothing.
                 He soon gave up his position as a professor, and for  
the rest
                 of his life wandered from one menial job to another.  
His experiences
                 as a child prodigy had proven so painful that he  
decided for the
                 rest of his life to shun public exposure at all  
costs. Henceforth,
                 he denied his gifts, refused to think about  
mathematics, and above
                 all refused to perform as he had been made to do as  
a child. Instead,
                 he devoted his intellect almost exclusively to the  
collection
                 of streetcar transfers, and to the study of the  
history of his
                 native Boston. He worked hard at becoming a normal  
human being,
                 but never entirely succeeded. He found the concept  
of beauty,
                 for example, to be completely incomprehensible, and  
the idea of
                 sex repelled him. At fifteen he took a vow of  
celibacy, which
                 he apparently kept for the remainder of his life,  
dying a virgin
                 at the age of 46. He wore a vest summer and winter,  
and never
                 learned to bathe regularly. A comment that Aldous  
Huxley once
                 made about Sir Isaac Newton might equally have been  
said of Sidis.</P>
               <blockquote>
                 <P>For the price Newton had to pay for being a  
supreme intellect
                   was that he was incapable of friendship, love,  
fatherhood, and
                   many other desirable things. As a man he was a  
failure; as a
                   monster he was superb [5, p. 2222].</P>
               </blockquote>
               <P>There was a time when all precocious children were  
thought to
                 burn out the same way that Sidis did. The man most  
responsible
                 for changing this belief was Lewis M. Terman.  
Between 1900 and
                 1920 he was able to carry out a study of about a  
hundred gifted
                 children, and his observations convinced him that  
many of the
                 traditional beliefs about the gifted were little  
more than superstitions.
                 To confirm these observations, he obtained a grant  
from the Commonwealth
                 Fund in 1922, and used it to sift a population of  
more than a
                 quarter of a million children, selecting out all  
those with IQs
                 above 140 for further study. That group has been  
monitored continuously
                 ever since. Many of the previously held beliefs  
about the gifted
                 did indeed turn out to be false. The gifted are not  
weak or sickly,
                 and although the incidence of myopia is greater  
among them, they
                 are generally thought to be better looking than  
their contemporaries:
                 They are not nerds.</P>
               <P align="left">Nevertheless, in his rush to dispel  
the erroneous
                 beliefs about the gifted, Terman sometimes made  
claims not supported
                 by his own data. In fact, in some cases, the data  
suggests that
                 exactly the opposite conclusion should have been  
drawn. Terman's
                 own data shows that there is a definite connection  
between measured
                 intelligence and mental and social maladjustment.  
The consequences
                 of misinterpreting these data are so grave that it  
will pay to
                 re-examine them in some detail.</P>
               <P>Terman's longitudinal research on the gifted  
included a constant
                 assessment of mental health and social adjustment.  
Subjects were
                 classified into three categories: satisfactory  
adjustment, some
                 maladjustment, and serious maladjustment. Terman  
defined these
                 categories in the following way.</P>
               <P>1. Satisfactory. Subjects classified in this  
category were essentially
                 normal; i.e., their &quot;desires, emotions, and  
interests were
                 compatible with the social standards and  
pressures&quot; of their
                 group. Everyone, of course, has adjustment problems  
of one kind
                 or another. Satisfactory adjustment as here defined  
does not mean
                 perfect contentment and complete absence of  
problems, but rather
                 the ability to cope adequately with difficulties in  
the personal
                 make-up or in the subject's environment. Worry and  
anxiety when
                 warranted by the circumstances, or a tendency to be  
somewhat high
                 strung or nervous--provided such a tendency did not  
constitute
                 a definite personality problem--were allowed in this  
category.
                 2. Some maladjustment. Classified here were subjects  
with excessive
                 feelings of inadequacy or inferiority, nervous  
fatigue, mild anxiety
                 neurosis, and the like. The emotional conflicts,  
nervous tendencies
                 and social maladjustments of these individuals,  
while they presented
                 definite problems, were not beyond the ability of  
the individual
                 to handle, and there was no marked interference with  
social or
                 personal life or with achievement. Subjects whose  
behavior was
                 noticeably odd or freakish, but without evidence of  
serious neurotic
                 tendencies, were also classified in this category.  
3. Serious
                 maladjustment. a.) Classified as 3a were subjects  
who had shown
                 marked symptoms of anxiety, mental depression,  
personality maladjustment,
                 or psychopathic personality. This classification  
also includes
                 subjects who had suffered a &quot;nervous  
breakdown,&quot; provided
                 the condition was not severe enough to constitute a  
psychosis.
                 Subjects with a previous history of serious  
maladjustment or nervous
                 breakdown (without psychosis) were included here  
even though their
                 adjustment at the time of rating may have been  
entirely satisfactory.
                 b.) Classified as 3b were those subjects who had at  
any time suffered
                 a complete mental breakdown requiring  
hospitalization, whatever
                 their condition at the time of rating. In the  
majority of cases
                 the subjects were restored to reasonably good mental  
health after
                 a brief period of hospital care [6, pp. 99-101].</P>
               <P>In 1940, when the group was about 29 years of age,  
a large scale
                 examination was carried out. Included in that  
examination was
                 a high level test of verbal intelligence, designated  
at that time
                 the Concept Mastery, but later re-named the Concept  
Mastery test
                 form A. Terman found the following relationship  
between adjustment
                 and verbal intelligence. (These are raw scores, not  
IQs.)</P>

               <P>Similar conclusions can be drawn from these data as  
well. Again,
                 there is a definite trend shown for the maladjusted  
to make higher
                 scores than the satisfactorily adjusted. Again,  
women show symptoms
                 of maladjustment at lower scores than men. But the  
most alarming
                 thing of all is that the percentage of maladjustment  
shown for
                 both sexes rose in the 12 years since the previous  
examination.
                 The percentage of men showing maladjustment having  
risen from
                 21 percent to 29 percent, and the figure for women  
having risen
                 from 18 percent to 33 percent! Nearly double what it  
was before!</P>
               <P>How did Terman interpret these data? Terman  
states:</P>
               <blockquote>
                 <P>Although severe mental maladjustment is in  
general somewhat
                   more common among subjects who score high on the  
Concept Mastery
                   test, many of the most successful men of the  
entire group also
                   scored high on this test [7, p. 50].</P>
               </blockquote>
               <P>In other words, Terman deliberately tried to give  
the impression
                 that the relationship between verbal intelligence  
and mental and
                 social maladjustment was weak and unreliable. He did  
this by misdirection.
                 He gave a truthful answer to an irrelevant question.  
Terman failed
                 to realize that a small difference in means between  
two or more
                 distributions can have a dramatic effect on the  
percentage of
                 each group found at the tails of the distribution.  
The relevant
                 questions should have been &quot;what is the  
percentage of maladjustment
                 found at different levels of ability, and does this  
show a trend?&quot;
                 Terman's data can be used to find answers to these  
questions.</P>
               <P>The method used to solve this problem is a  
relatively simple
                 one but tedious in detail. (See appendix.) The  
results, however,
                 are easy to understand. Using CMT-T scores for men  
as an illustration,
                 and pooling the data for some maladjustment and  
serious maladjustment,
                 the following percentages can be obtained.</P>

               <P>By comparison, the Triple Nine Society averages  
155.16 on the
                 CMT-T, and the average score for Prometheus Society  
members is
                 169.95 [1, 2]. The implications are staggering,  
especially when
                 it is realized that these percentages do not include  
women, who
                 show more maladjustment at lower CMT-T scores than  
men do. Perhaps
                 this is one of the reasons why super high IQ  
societies suffer
                 so much from schisms and a tendency towards  
disintegration. In
                 any event, one thing is certain. The currently  
accepted belief
                 that verbal intelligence is unrelated to  
maladjustment is clearly
                 a myth.</P>
               <P>Nevertheless, while Terman's data do provide a  
prima facie case
                 for a connection between verbal intelligence and  
maladjustment,
                 they fail to explain the causal mechanism involved.  
To obtain
                 such insight requires close observation by a gifted  
observer.
                 Fortunately, those insights are available to us in  
Leta S. Hollingworth's
                 book, Children above 180 IQ. Hollingworth not only  
observed her
                 subjects as children, she also continued to maintain  
some contact
                 with them after they had reached maturity. So  
although her book
                 is ostensibly about children, it is in fact laced  
throughout by
                 her observations on exceptionally gifted adults as  
well.</P>
               <P>Before examining Hollingworth's findings, however,  
it is necessary
                 to explain how childhood IQs are related to adult  
mental ability.
                 As a child ages, his IQ tends to regress to the mean  
of the population
                 of which he is a member. This is partly due to the  
imperfect reliability
                 of the test, and partly due to the uneven rate of  
maturation.
                 The earlier the IQ is obtained, and the higher the  
score, the
                 more the IQ can be expected to regress by the time  
the child becomes
                 an adult. So although Hollingworth's children were  
all selected
                 to have IQs above 180, their adult status was not  
nearly so high.
                 In fact, as adults, there's good reason to believe  
that their
                 abilities averaged only slightly above that of the  
average Triple
                 Nine member. Evidence for this conjecture comes from  
the Terman
                 research data. Terman observed the following  
relationship between
                 childhood IQs on the Stanford-Binet and adult status  
on the Concept
                 Mastery test form T.</P>

               <P>The average childhood IQ score for those with  
childhood IQs above
                 170 was 177.7 for men, and 177.6 for women. That's  
quite close
                 to the 180 cutoff used by Leta Hollingworth in  
selecting her subjects.
                 Note that Terman's subjects who scored above 170 IQ  
as children
                 averaged 155.8 on the CMT-T at age 41, a score quite  
close to
                 the 155.16 made by the average Triple Nine member.  
Such a close
                 match makes it reasonable to generalize  
Hollingworth's findings
                 to members of both the Triple Nine Society and the  
Prometheus
                 Society.</P>
               <P>Hollingworth identified a number of adjustment  
problems caused
                 by school acceleration. As this is rarely practiced  
in today's
                 educational system, these are no longer problems and  
will not
                 be discussed. There still remain, however, four  
adjustment problems
                 that continue to perplex the gifted throughout their  
lives, two
                 applying to all levels of giftedness, and two  
applying almost
                 exclusively to the exceptionally gifted--i.e. those  
with childhood
                 IQs above 170, or adult Concept Mastery test (T)  
scores above
                 155.</P>
               <P>One of the problems faced by all gifted persons is  
learning to
                 focus their efforts for prolonged periods of time.  
Since so much
                 comes easily to them, they may never acquire the  
self-discipline
                 necessary to use their gifts to the fullest.  
Hollingworth describes
                 how the habit begins.</P>
               <P>Where the gifted child drifts in the school  
unrecognized, working
                 chronically below his capacity (even though young  
for his grade),
                 he receives daily practice in habits of idleness and  
daydreaming.
                 His abilities never receive the stimulus of genuine  
challenge,
                 and the situation tends to form in him the  
expectation of an effortless
                 existence [3, p. 258].</P>
               <P>But if the &quot;average&quot; gifted child tends  
to acquire
                 bad adjustment habits in the ordinary schoolroom,  
the exceptionally
                 gifted have even more problems. Hollingworth  
continues:</P>
               <blockquote>
                 <P>Children with IQs up to 150 get along in the  
ordinary course
                   of school life quite well, achieving excellent  
marks without
                   serious effort. But children above this mental  
status become
                   almost intolerably bored with school work if kept  
in lockstep
                   with unselected pupils of their own age. Children  
who rise above
                   170 IQ are liable to regard school with  
indifference or with
                   positive dislike, for they find nothing in the  
work to absorb
                   their interest. This condition of affairs, coupled  
with the
                   supervision of unseeing and unsympathetic  
teachers, has sometimes
                   led even to truancy on the part of gifted children  
[3, p. 258].</P>
               </blockquote>
               <P>A second adjustment problem faced by all gifted  
persons is due
                 to their uncommon versatility. Hollingworth says:</P>
               <P>Another problem of development with reference to  
occupation grows
                 out of the versatility of these children. So far  
from being one-sided
                 in ability and interest, they are typically capable  
of so many
                 different kinds of success that they may have  
difficulty in confining
                 themselves to a reasonable number of enterprises.  
Some of them
                 are lost to usefulness through spreading their  
available time
                 and energy over such a wide array of projects that  
nothing can
                 be finished or done perfectly. After all, time and  
space are limited
                 for the gifted as for others, and the life-span is  
probably not
                 much longer for them than for others. A choice must  
be made among
                 the numerous possibilities, since modern life calls  
for specialization
                 [3, p. 259].</P>
               <P>A third problem faced by the gifted is learning to  
suffer fools
                 gladly. Hollingworth notes:</P>
               <P>A lesson which many gifted persons never learn as  
long as they
                 live is that human beings in general are inherently  
very different
                 from themselves in thought, in action, in general  
intention, and
                 in interests. Many a reformer has died at the hands  
of a mob which
                 he was trying to improve in the belief that other  
human beings
                 can and should enjoy what he enjoys. This is one of  
the most painful
                 and difficult lessons that each gifted child must  
learn, if personal
                 development is to proceed successfully. It is more  
necessary that
                 this be learned than that any school subject be  
mastered. Failure
                 to learn how to tolerate in a reasonable fashion the  
foolishness
                 of others leads to bitterness, disillusionment, and  
misanthropy
                 [3, p. 259].</P>
               <P>The single greatest adjustment problem faced by the  
gifted, however,
                 is their tendency to become isolated from the rest  
of humanity.
                 This problem is especially acute among the  
exceptionally gifted.
                 Hollingworth says:</P>
               <P>This tendency to become isolated is one of the most  
important
                 factors to be considered in guiding the development  
of personality
                 in highly intelligent children, but it does not  
become a serious
                 problem except at the very extreme degrees of  
intelligence. The
                 majority of children between 130 and 150 find fairly  
easy adjustment,
                 because neighborhoods and schools are selective, so  
that like-minded
                 children tend to be located in the same schools and  
districts.
                 Furthermore, the gifted child, being large and  
strong for his
                 age, is acceptable to playmates a year or two older.  
Great difficulty
                 arises only when a young child is above 160 IQ. At  
the extremely
                 high levels of 180 or 190 IQ, the problem of  
friendships is difficult
                 indeed, and the younger the person the more  
difficult it is. The
                 trouble decreases with age because as persons become  
adult, they
                 naturally seek and find on their own initiative  
groups who are
                 like-minded, such as learned societies [3, p. 264].</P>
               <P>Hollingworth points out that the exceptionally  
gifted do not
                 deliberately choose isolation, but are forced into  
it against
                 their wills.</P>
               <P>These superior children are not unfriendly or  
ungregarious by
                 nature. Typically they strive to play with others  
but their efforts
                 are defeated by the difficulties of the case...  
Other children
                 do not share their interests, their vocabulary, or  
their desire
                 to organize activities. They try to reform their  
contemporaries
                 but finally give up the struggle and play alone,  
since older children
                 regard them as &quot;babies,&quot; and adults seldom  
play during
                 hours when children are awake. As a result, forms of  
solitary
                 play develop, and these, becoming fixed as habits,  
may explain
                 the fact that many highly intellectual adults are  
shy, ungregarious,
                 and unmindful of human relationships, or even  
misanthropic and
                 uncomfortable in ordinary social intercourse [3, p.  
262].</P>
               <P>But if the exceptionally gifted is isolated from  
his contemporaries,
                 the gulf between him and the adult authorities in  
his life is
                 even deeper.</P>
               <P>The very gifted child or adolescent, perceiving the  
illogical
                 conduct of those in charge of his affairs, may turn  
rebellious
                 against all authority and fall into a condition of  
negative suggestibility--a
                 most unfortunate trend of personality, since the  
person is then
                 unable to take a cooperative attitude toward  
authority. A person
                 who is highly suggestible in a negative direction is  
as much in
                 bondage to others around him as is the person who is  
positively
                 suggestible. The social value of the person is  
seriously impaired
                 in either case. The gifted are not likely to fall  
victims to positive
                 suggestion but many of them develop negativism to a  
conspicuous
                 degree [3, p 260].</P>
               <P>Anyone reading the super high IQ journals is aware  
of the truth
                 of this statement. Negative individuals abound in  
every high IQ
                 society.</P>
               <P>Hollingworth distilled her observations into two  
ideas that are
                 among the most important ever discovered for the  
understanding
                 of gifted behavior. The first is the concept of an  
optimum adjustment
                 range. She says:</P>
               <blockquote>
                 <P>All things considered, the psychologist who has  
observed the
                   development of gifted children over a long period  
of time from
                   early childhood to maturity, evolves the idea that  
there is
                   a certain restricted portion of the total range of  
intelligence
                   which is most favorable to the development of  
successful and
                   well-rounded personality in the world as it now  
exists. This
                   limited range appears to be somewhere between 125  
and 155 IQ.
                   Children and adolescents in this area are enough  
more intelligent
                   than the average to win the confidence of large  
numbers of their
                   fellows, which brings about leadership, and to  
manage their
                   own lives with superior efficiency. Moreover,  
there are enough
                   of them to afford mutual esteem and understanding.  
But those
                   of 170 IQ and beyond are too intelligent to be  
understood by
                   the general run of persons with whom they make  
contact. They
                   are too infrequent to find congenial companions.  
They have to
                   contend with loneliness and personal isolation  
from their contemporaries
                   throughout the period of their immaturity. To what  
extent these
                   patterns become fixed, we cannot yet tell [3, p.  
264].</P>
               </blockquote>
               <P>Hollingworth's second seminal idea is that of a  
&quot;communication
                 range.&quot; She does not state this explicitly, but  
it can be
                 inferred from some of her comments on leadership.</P>
               <P>Observation shows that there is a direct ratio  
between the intelligence
                 of the leader and that of the led. To be a leader of  
his contemporaries
                 a child must be more intelligent but not too much  
more intelligent
                 than those to be led... But generally speaking, a  
leadership pattern
                 will not form--or it will break up--when a  
discrepancy of more
                 than about 30 points of IQ comes to exist between  
leader and led
                 [3, p. 287].</P>
               <P>The implication is that there is a limit beyond  
which genuine
                 communication between different levels of  
intelligence becomes
                 impossible. To say that a child or an adult is  
intellectually
                 isolated from his contemporaries is to say that  
everyone in his
                 environment has an IQ at least 30 points different  
from his own.
                 Knowing only a person's IQ, then, is not enough to  
tell how well
                 he's likely to cope with his environment. Some  
knowledge of the
                 intellectual level of his environment is also  
necessary.</P>
               <P>If the optimum range of intelligence lies between  
125 and 155
                 IQ, as Hollingworth suggests, then it follows that  
155 can be
                 thought of as a threshold separating an optimum  
adjustment zone
                 below it from a suboptimum range above it. Other  
psychologists
                 have also noticed how this score tends to divide  
people into two
                 naturally occurring categories. Among these is one  
of the doyens
                 of psychometrics, David Wechsler. He comments:</P>
               <P>The topics of genius and degeneration are only  
special cases
                 of the more general problem involved in the  
evaluation of human
                 capacities, namely the quantitative versus  
qualitative. There
                 are those who insist that all differences are  
qualitative, and
                 those who with equal conviction maintain that they  
are exclusively
                 quantitative. The true answer is that they are both.  
General intelligence,
                 for example, is undoubtedly quantitative in the  
sense that it
                 consists of varying amounts of the same basic stuff  
(e.g., mental
                 energy) which can be expressed by continuous  
numerical measures
                 like intelligence Quotients or Mental-Age scores,  
and these are
                 as real as any physical measurements are. But it is  
equally certain
                 that our description of the difference between a  
genius and an
                 average person by a statement to the effect that he  
has an IQ
                 greater by this or that amount, does not describe  
the difference
                 between them as completely or in the same way as  
when we say that
                 a mile is much longer than an inch. The genius (as  
regards intellectual
                 ability) not only has an IQ of say 50 points more  
than the average
                 person, but in virtue of this difference acquires  
seemingly new
                 aspects (potentialities) or characteristics. These  
seemingly new
                 aspects or characteristics, in their totality, are  
what go to
                 make up the &quot;qualitative&quot; difference  
between them [9,
                 p. 134].</P>
               <P>Wechsler is saying quite plainly that those with  
IQs above 150
                 are different in kind from those below that level.  
He is saying
                 that they are a different kind of mind, a different  
kind of human
                 being.</P>
               <P>This subjective impression of a difference in kind  
also appears
                 to be fairly common among members of the super high  
IQ societies
                 themselves. When Prometheus and Triple Nine members  
were asked
                 if they perceived a categorical difference between  
those above
                 this level and others, most said that they did,  
although they
                 also said that they were reluctant to call the  
difference genius.
                 When asked what it should be called, they produced a  
number of
                 suggestions, sometimes esoteric, sometimes witty,  
and often remarkably
                 vulgar. But one term was suggested independently  
again and again.
                 Many thought that the most appropriate term for  
people like themselves
                 was Outsider.</P>
               <P>The feeling of estrangement, or at least  
detachment, from society
                 at large is not merely subjective illusion. Society  
is not geared
                 to deal effectively with the exceptionally gifted  
adult because
                 almost nothing objective is known about him. It is a  
commonplace
                 observation that no psychometric instrument can be  
validly used
                 to evaluate a person unless others like him were  
included in the
                 test's norming sample. Yet those with IQs above 150  
are so rare
                 that few if any were ever included in the norming  
sample of any
                 of the most commonly used tests, tests like the  
Strong-Campbell
                 Interest Inventory, the Kuder Vocational Preference  
Record, the
                 MMPI and so on. As a consequence, objective self- 
knowledge for
                 the exceptionally gifted is nearly impossible to  
obtain. What
                 he most needs to know is not how he differs from  
ordinary people--he
                 is acutely aware of that--but how he is both like  
and unlike those
                 of his own kind. The most commonly used tests can't  
provide that
                 knowledge, so he is forced to find out in more  
roundabout ways.
                 It is his attempts to find answers to these  
questions that may
                 explain the emergence of the super high IQ  
societies. Where else
                 can he find peers against which to measure himself?</P>
               <P>There appear to be three sorts of childhoods and  
three sorts
                 of adult social adaptations made by the gifted. The  
first of these
                 may be called the committed strategy. These  
individuals were born
                 into upper middle class families, with gifted and  
well educated
                 parents, and often with gifted siblings. They  
sometimes even had
                 famous relatives. They attended prestigious  
colleges, became doctors,
                 lawyers, professors, or joined some other  
prestigious occupation,
                 and have friends with similar histories. They are  
the optimally
                 adjusted. They are also the ones most likely to  
disbelieve that
                 the exceptionally gifted can have serious adjustment  
problems.</P>
               <P>The second kind of social adaptation may be called  
the marginal
                 strategy. These individuals were typically born into  
a lower socio-economic
                 class, without gifted parents, gifted siblings, or  
gifted friends.
                 Often they did not go to college at all, but instead  
went right
                 to work immediately after high school, or even  
before. And although
                 they may superficially appear to have made a good  
adjustment to
                 their work and friends, neither work nor friends can  
completely
                 engage their attention. They hunger for more  
intellectual challenge
                 and more real companionship than their social  
environment can
                 supply. So they resort to leading a double life.  
They compartmentalize
                 their life into a public sphere and a private  
sphere. In public
                 they go through the motions of fulfilling their  
social roles,
                 whatever they are, but in private they pursue goals  
of their own.
                 They are often omnivorous readers, and sometimes  
unusually expert
                 amateurs in specialized subjects. The double life  
strategy might
                 even be called the genius ploy, as many geniuses in  
history have
                 worked at menial tasks in order to free themselves  
for more important
                 work. Socrates, you will remember was a stone mason,  
Spinoza was
                 a lens grinder, and even Jesus was a carpenter. The  
exceptionally
                 gifted adult who works as a parking lot attendant  
while creating
                 new mathematics has adopted an honored way of life  
and deserves
                 respect for his courage, not criticism for failing  
to live up
                 to his abilities. Those conformists who adopt the  
committed strategy
                 may be pillars of their community and make the world  
go around,
                 but historically, those with truly original minds  
have more often
                 adopted the double life tactic. They are ones among  
the gifted
                 who are most likely to make the world go forward.</P>
               <P>And finally there are the dropouts. These sometimes  
bizarre individuals
                 were often born into families in which one or more  
of the parents
                 were not only exceptionally gifted, but  
exceptionally maladjusted
                 themselves. This is the worst possible social  
environment that
                 a gifted child can be thrust into. His parents,  
often driven by
                 egocentric ambitions of their own, may use him to  
gratify their
                 own needs for accomplishment. He is, to all intents  
and purposes,
                 not a living human being to them, but a performing  
animal, or
                 even an experiment. That is what happened to Sidis,  
and may be
                 the explanation for all those gifted who &quot;burn  
out&quot;
                 as he did. (Readers familiar with the Terman study  
will recognize
                 the committed strategy and the marginal strategy as  
roughly similar
                 to the adjustment patterns of Terman's A and C  
groups.)</P>
               <P>If the exceptionally gifted adult with an IQ of  
150, or 160,
                 or 170 has problems in adapting to his world, what  
must it have
                 been like for William James Sidis, whose IQ was 250  
or more?</P>
               <P>Aldous Huxley once wrote:</P>
               <blockquote>
                 <P>Perhaps men of genius are the only true men. In  
all the history
                   of the race there have been only a few thousand  
real men. And
                   the rest of us--what are we? Teachable animals.  
Without the
                   help of the real man, we should have found out  
almost nothing
                   at all. Almost all the ideas with which we are  
familiar could
                   never have occurred to minds like ours. Plant the  
seeds there
                   and they will grow; but our minds could never  
spontaneously
                   have generated them [4, p. 2242].</P>
               </blockquote>
               <P>And so we see that the explanation for the Sidis  
tragedy is simple.
                 Sidis was a feral child; a true man born into a  
world filled with
                 animals--a world filled with us.</P>

<p/>
It has often been said that mathematics is the cheapest university  
department to run, for all one needs is pencil, a desk and a waste  
paper basket. This is not so. Philosophy is cheaper still, since in  
philosophy we do not even need the basket.

<h3><a name="Turing'sDelirium">Fri 22 Sep 2006 : Turing's Delirium</a></h3>
<p/>
Edmundo Paz Solden is a prolific spanish language novelist but a
relatively new name to English-speaking audiences. The Bolivian
writer has just released his sixth novel, but it's only the second to
be translated into English. The book is called Turing's Delirium.

<p/>

An old dictator, Montenegro, has been democratically returned to
power in Bolivia, mere decades after a bloody anti-communist reign.
New Bolivia is now a player on the global stage, but a poor player,
easily abused. Edmundo Paz Solden's tale is set in the fictional city
of Rio Fugitivo, where the local power company has been privatised
and bought by a multinational firm. Far from this bringing benefits,
the price of electricity has skyrocketed and there are constant
blackouts.

<p/>

This sets the scene for a battle between angry young people who use
computers to hack and vandalise these new global enemies, and the
state's; in particular the codebreakers of the old regime who work in 
a place called The Black Chamber. Part of this story is told through 
the mind of a dying man ... Albert, the founder of The Black Chamber. 
His mind is slipping. He's a beligerent and evil old bastard who's 
determined to live, but who's losing his grip on reality.

<h3><a name="Thenightcountry">Fri 22 Sep 2006 : The night country</a></h3>
<pre>
I sat, once more in the late hours of darkness, in the
airport of a foreign city.  I was tired as only both
the sufferer from insomnia and the traveler can be
tired.  I had missed a plane and had almost a whole
night's wait before me. I could not sleep. The long
corridor was deserted. Even the cleaning women had
passed by.

In that white efficient glare I grew ever more
depressed and weary. I was tired of the endless
comings and goings of my profession; I was tired of
customs officers and police. I was lonely for home. My
eyes hurt. I was, unconsciously perhaps, looking for
that warm stone, that hawthorn leaf, where, in the
words of the poet, man trades in at last his wife and
friend. I had an ocean to cross; the effort seemed
unbearable. I rested my aching head upon my hand.

Later, beginning at the far end of that desolate
corridor, I saw a man moving slowly toward me.  In a
small corner of my eye I merely noted him. He limped,
painfully and grotesquely, upon a heavy cane. He was
far away, and it was no matter to me. I shifted the
unpleasant mote out of my eye.

But, after a time, I could still feel him approaching,
and in one of those white moments of penetration which
are so dreadful, my eyes were drawn back to him as he
came on.  With an anatomist's eye I saw this amazing
conglomeration of sticks and broken, misshapen pulleys
which make up the body of man. Here was an apt
subject, and I flew to a raging mental dissection. 
How could anyone, I contended, trapped in this
mechanical thing of joints and sliding wires expect
the acts it performed to go other than awry?

The man limped on, relentlessly.

How, oh God, I entreated, did we become trapped within
this substance out of which we stare so hopelessly
upon our own eventual dissolution? How for a single
minute could we dream or imagine that thought would
save us, children deliver us, from the body of this
death? Not in time, my mind rang with my despair; not
in mortal time, not in this place, not anywhere in the
world would blood be staunched, or the dark wrong be
forever righted, or the parted be rejoined. Not in
this time, not mortal time. The substance was too
gross, our utopias bought with too much pain."

<pre>1953. US. Death row. A bad poem, but elevated by its monumental context
and constrained by a simple encipherment revealing the authors.

Even so, we did what we believed in:
Treason, yes, perhaps, but with good cause.
History will judge by its own laws,
Each act within the sunlight of the season.
Love was what inspired us, a reason
As pure as any saint in Satan's jaws.
Nor was the god we worshipped through those wars
Demonized, as later all would see him.
Justice would not just sustain our guilt,
Undoing those who would undo a wrong,
Leaving us in lucid infamy.
Instead, it would remember what we willed
Under the illusion of a song
So beautiful it would the chained earth free.

<h3><a name="Hereyeshadgreatclarity">Mon 18 Sep 2006 : Her eyes had great clarity</a></h3>
Why do we say 'her eyes had great clarity'?
<p/>
Anatomically and from embryogenesis the eyes are an extension of the  
brain. The retina is a 6 layer neural network. For people in the  
mathematical sciences visual cognition has been coopted via notation  
and spacial constructs into a more general cognitive ability. Those  
with innate spacial intelligence often flourish in that realm.  
Further the lens, that which is clear or cloudy, has an extremely  
interesting vasculture; edge capillaries feed a central diffusion  
network (to keep the lens free of stray proteins and red corpuscles).  
Random deposits in the lens are likely to be correlated with deposits  
in the rest of the brain that have crossed the blood brain barrier  
(this is distributed physical-chemical barrier that gives neurons  
their own purified, haemless nutriment supply).
<p/>
What can we say of people who wear glasses? Of people who score well on
IQ tests, a disproportionate number have glasses (but not the other way around).
One of the most powerful predictors of myopia is
is (overly) rapid growth during embryogenesis  
of the visual system. When non-grain  
societies with no history of myopia are introduced to grain diets  
myopia sores. Typical polynesian rates are now 30-50%. This seems to  
be caused by IGF-1 (insulin related growth factor) bursts following  
ingestion of high GI grain products during pregnancy. Different parts of  
the lens and supporting tissue respond to these bursts at different rates, resulting in
selective overdevelopment and global distortion. But IGF-1 has receptors all  
over the body and nervous system; it seems probable the unusual lens growth is reflected in the  
rest of the visual system. 3.7Kg is the average birthweight of an  
Australian infant. 4.2Kg brings an infant 3x more likey to develop
myopia. But what hidden strengths and ailments does growth induced myopia also bring?
<p/>
There are some related phrases with an obvious physiological basis to
their etymology.
e.g "flashing eyes", "wide eyed curiosity"  and "focussed".

<h3><a name="Consciousnessamplification">Wed 06 Sep 2006 : Consciousness amplification</a></h3>
When the bladder is full but social sanction or distractions prevent  
instant relief, what does one do?
<p/>
Jiggles about like a parkinsons patient! Simulating movement -- and  
if that is not enough, one does away with the similation and paces to  
and fro. One is a simulation but both are <i>stimulation</i>.
<p/>
Over micturation we have limited conscious (verbal) control. Over  
movement we have greater conscious control. We use our conscious  
control over the latter to gain control over the former. Movement  
becomes the lever through which the conscious mind is amplified to  
control a greater share of the body.
<p/>
The primitive cortex, the "inner lobster", ignores conscious  
statements about not micturating when the bladder is full. However it  
measures the movement of the body. It is simple and easily fooled by  
jiggling -- simulating walking.
<p/>
Newborns too are fooled by the simulated walking of their parents to  
keep them calm. Here we see the first simple evidence that control  
over the body translates to control over emotional states.
<p/>
Through techniques and calibrations like these we become not more  
conscious but our consciousness becomes more powerful --- the verbal  
will and higher planing centres of the neocortex and associated  
structures such as the cingulate cortex are able to obtain greater  
control over their environment.
<p/>
We can see this to an extreme degree in those who are able to  
meditate their way through a C-section. Here the conscious domination  
of the inner lobster has been developed to such a degree that the  
little crustacean can not even flinch before the surgeon's cut.

<h3><a name="Tamingtheinnerrat.">Thu 03 Aug 2006 : Taming the inner rat.</a></h3>
<p/>
Don't worry about self flagellating christian guilt mania diet 
nonsense. Think about how much you eat. Think about the effect of

being even 1 potato chip per plate out between energy demands 
and consumption. Daily energy demands for a woman approximates 10 mega  

joules. Pure fat has an energy density of around 3000 Kj/100g. So 
your energy demands can be met each day by a little over 333 gms of 
fat. A finger of butter or 3-5 chocolate bars. If you're 1/20th out, 
that's 17 gms of fat per day. Or 7.3Kg/year of pure fat. But adipose 
tissue is a complex of fat cells storing around 15Mj/Kg. So this 
translates to a 12.3Kg/year weight gain or loss (loss is easier to 
model as an extreme, due to fat cells having basel energy 
requirements). To the naive this would suggest a forward path of 
extreme conscious dietry control, but a little reflection will 
demonstrate that since most people are in equilibrium subconscious 
mechanisms must already tightly control body composition.
<p/>
For what follows it is important to understand what <i>you</i> are. 
<i>You</i> are not your appetite. Now if we examine <i>you</i> 
closely, we see, merci, there is no clear place where <i>you</i> end 
and the rest of the universe begins. Likewise, there is no place 
where <i>I</i> end and the rest of the universe begins. Now invoking 
transitivity we see there is there is no place where <i>you</i> end 
and <i>I</i> begin. We are one. But <i>you</i> and <i>I</i> are words  

people use frequently and take pains not to confuse. This difference 
in language suggests a difference in reality that yields predictive 
power when dichotomised into two words. There's no place where 
<i>red</i> ends and <i>green</i> begins either, but <i>red</i> is not  

<i>green</i> even if they are on a spectrum. Rhetoricians call 
red=green <i>argument from false spectrum</i>. But just like <i>I</i>  

am not <i>you</i>, your breath is not <i>you</i>, your finger is not 
<i>you</i>, your eyes are not <i>you</i>, your thyroid, pituitary 
gland and medulla are not <i>you</i>, no neuron is <i>you</i>, 
infact, none of the parts of <i>you</i> are <i>you</i>.
<p/>
<i>You</i> don't exist as discrete thing, because as we have now 
established, not only is there no place where <i>you</i> end, there 
is not even a place where <i>you</i> begin. But we know the word is 
useful! So what can we say? Since <i>you</i> are reading these words 
<i>you</i> are the ensemble of strongly connected (i.e primarily 
brain) causality interactions connected to the input of these words. 
In the same way the word <i>Paris</i> is has greater predictive power  

the closer it is to the epicenter of connectivity of the French 
capital, but <i>Paris</i> is not the geographical or connective 
epicentre of <i>Paris</i>. Now <i>France</i> is to <i>Paris</i>, as 
your brain is to the language processing areas of your brain. But 
within <i>France</i> there are other cities such as <i>Le Mon Atier-
les-Bains
</i> or <i>Grenoble</i>, that should not be called <i>Paris</i> 
because their connectivity with <i>Paris</i> is very weak. So to, 
<b>within your brain there are subsystems the language processing 
areas are not meaning fully connected to</b>. They operate independently. Many of 
parts of the cortex and brain stem are ancient and do not differ 
appreciably to identical subsystems in rats, crocodiles, or even 
lobsters. In particular those parts of the brain that regulate basic 
needs such as arousal, temperature, blood pressure, <i>and appetite</i> are very ancient.
<p/>
We already established that <i>you</i> and these other sub regions of  

the brain must be different if the word <i>you</i> is to retain 
meaning. Hence we come to the following remarkable conclusion. 
<b><i>You</i> share your body with a lobster!</b> This lobster, or 
perhaps more romantically, "inner rat", is a simple creature, and it 
controls homeostasis. It controls appetite and activity and <i>You</i> have no direct control over it. All <i>you</i> can do is move it 
from place to place and buy different things for it to eat. Otherwise  

<i>you</i> have less control over it than it has over <i>you</i> 
because it is able to influence your feelings of reward, temperature,  

hunger and activity.
<p/>
This creature is very good at measuring your body composition and 
controlling your appetite without conscious control. It's a lovely, 
sophisticated device. If you don't want to get fat, eat cashews, not 
marshmellows, even though the former have four times the energy 
density, for they are a source of plant life to be and due to the 
common ancestory of man and plant a good source of life for women; a 
rich bounty that tells the lobster its food supply is plentiful. 
Marshmellows and other refined foods she may need to eat a mountain 
of to get, say, her folic acid needs met; a poor diet which may 
activate biological strategies for dealing with food scarcity (Store 
emergency reserves; We can't live on this stuff!).
<p/>
Lack of exercise does not make people fat through decreased energy 
demands. Rather it changes the lobsters's perception as to how much 
weight the body may carry without detrimental effect. Exercised 
induced overheating and over energy expenditure from lugging extra 
weight around (it takes twice as much energy to lift twice as much 
weight) will be measured by the brain through metabolic products in 
the blood, activating body composition modification via change of 
appetite and activity levels, moving body composition to a form 
better suited to the exercise rich environment in which it finds 
itself. Everyone knows muscle fibres grow in response to exercise, 
but adaptions take place throughout the body and brain to minimise 
exercise induced stress and maximise efficiency. It's an optimisation  

problem with two variables. Reserves vs. movement efficiency. The 
global optima depends on the weightings of these two variables. 
<i>You</i> can change the weighting through conscious behavior, 
behavior which subconscious brain regions will then measure to 
control your appetite. God, who lets no good deed go unpunished, has 
ensured the traditional energy reduction diet has the effect of 
activating genetic food scarcity strategies, increasing appetite, 
decreasing activity and so resulting in subsequent weight gain.
<p/>
My advise to anyone who wants to loose weight; deny yourself no 
complex food that primitive man would eat (vegetables, red meat, 
including organs, fish, eggs, fruit, nuts, all simply prepared). Your  

lobster knows how to be respond to those foods. Eat slowly 
so appetite change can control intake. Within this structure eat 
whatever tastes the most appealing. Foods which have something you 
lack will taste nicer till the need is for filled. Exercise to create  

weight induced over heating and carry stress to activate weight 
reduction strategies. How many overweight long distance runners do 
you know?

But then thundering, inexorable realisation that the world is what  
the brain makes. Constraints in the meat give form to the symbols on  
the paper, to every inclination and imagining, to every cognitive  
process. Here then, this very sentence, out of the countable  
arrangements of matter limited to just a few forms the brain can see.  
So, on to understand the brain to understand the mind to understand  
mathematics to understand physics to understand the world, but then,  
just when this seems to be the path to enlightenment we see that  
constraints in the meat must arise from physical constraints. The  
meat of perception has been shaped by iterated selection and  
variation of ancestral nervous systems. How can we describe the  
tendencies of selection? By its constraints. The constraints of the  
physical system in which it selected. Above all, life must <i>live</i> and that is constrained by energy and momentum and mass and time  
and charge and gravity. A creature's abilities and imaginings reflect  
adaption to these constraints. We have no other notion but to point  
and say <i>there it is</i>. But these physical concepts are concepts  
of the mind. The self description is the constrained language of the  
brain. All folds in on itself. Start anywhere. Start nowhere. With  
boundless insight draw the circle tighter, but a circle it remains.  
How to hack reality? How to pierce the skin? How to find the spot on  
the wall where the illusion flickers and rip it open? We can relate  
here to there. Thing to Thing. How can there be more? How can there

<p/>
We all have emotional instincts which react against our perceptions  
of the world.
The interaction of these reactions losely defines society. If we  
perceive
differently we react differently. An important class of perceptions are
those things we can measure. By measuring different things we can change
perception. By changing perception we can change reactions. By changing
reactions we can change society.
<p/>

Society has grown beyond our ability to perceive it accurately. Our
brains are not adapted to the environment in which we find outselves.
We can't predict important aspects of our societal environment. It's
not designed to run on our brains. We're maladapted. In our
evolutionary history we spent a lot of time tracking the behavior and
reputations of small number of people we saw frequently. If we want
some of the social benefits that a small society brings then we need
computational crutches so when A fucks over B any C considering dealing
with A will know. A society that can "think" in this way is able to
route goodness to people who do good and away from those people who
generate hurt. The decision as to what is good is too complicated to be
formulated in regulation and elections are a very coarse expression of
what people think is good. Any paper formulation will put power in the
hands of a political and technocratic elite. Robust routing
decisions must be made my individuals and individuals need tools to
manage complexity enough so they can make them effectively in a modern
society. You might argue that this just removes power one step -- now
it's in the hands of people who measure things. Right. But it is
one step removed and if history is a guide that one step can make
all the difference.

Apropos Finland:

<pre>
Transparency in the cold light of Finland

Therese Catanzariti Crikey's Scandinavian correspondent

In Finland, all individual tax returns are public information which
makes for some interesting number crunching from the local media, as our
Scandinavian correspondent, Therese Catanzariti, writes:

Have you ever wondered what your colleagues are earning? Have you ever
wondered what your peer group are earning? Your next door neigbour? Your
cousin? A guy you went to school with?

  Finland takes "nosy-ness" to new dizzying heights. Finland is the most
  transparent public sector in the world but for those who think  everyone
  should follow their lead, think about this. Think about this very very
  carefully.

  All individual tax returns are public. Public. Yes. Public. No ATO
  secrecy and caring about your privacy for the Finnish Vero.

  What does this mean? Every year the main newspapers trawl through the
  Finnish tax office. They then prepare a list of the top 1000 income
  earners and the top 1000 capital income earners. Then they publish it.
  The list shows name, job, town and year of birth. It shows income
  (including stock options) and wealth. And then, the piece de
  resistance, how much tax paid as a proportion of salary.

  There is even a list of last year's rankings - who is shooting up the
  charts? Who has fallen on (relatively) hard times?

  Who is on the list? Lots of Nokia, partly because "income" includes
  stock options. Apparently last year when the stock was doing well,
  Nokia employees did a pretty clean sweep of the top places. Then
  there's Jaako Salovaara, the only person under 30 in the top 20.
  And the guys from Instrumentarium who just got bought out by GE and
  got options.

  And this being high-tech Finland, you can use the search machine on  the
  website to tailor the list and rank the results.

  Who are your local millionaires? Insert a town in Finland in the
  box "Kunta".

  Who are the young guns making a fortune? Scroll down the box "Ika"

  Where are the women? Choose "naisen" from the box "Sukupuoli"

  Or just cut to the chase - insert a name in the box "Nimi" and find  out
  how your boss is doing.

  In addition to the list, Finnish journalists highlight a few other
  interesting and anamalous tax returns. One box in the Finnish printed
  newspaper had a box of salaries of all the union bosses. Why does the
  head of the teacher's union earn over 200,000 euros a year? How can he
  empathise with his comrades struggling with low pay?

  And this being transparent Finland, the Finnish newspaper Helsingin
  Sanomat did not hide that some of the wealthiest people on the capital
  list are involved with the Sanomat newspaper group.

  But this is just what the mainstream newspapers do. There are also
  boutique publications that publish guides of everyone who earns over
  around 40,000 euros. They put a few stories in so they can argue it's
  news. But other than that, it's just one long list of everyone you
  know. And when there are only 5 million people in the country, and  very
  very few foreigners, you know a lot of people. If you want your own
  copy, here's the link (alas, Finnish only) -
  http://www.veroporssi.com/index.php

  But hang on. We're in Finland, super-connected super wireless Finland.
  If you think newspapers and websites are yesterday, try SMS. You can
  send an SMS to the following number 16400 (yes, it works outside
  Finland +358 16400) with the text "vero first name last name". And lo,
  it will send you back the taxable income of that person in the last
  financial year.

  So is this a good idea?

  Well it works in Finland because of the Finns. Finland is not a  country
  of keeping up with the Jones's. In fact, Finland is more a country of
  shame about obvious wealth - they want to appear as if they are behind
  the Jones's. One of the statistics the Finns are most proud of is the
  relatively small difference between the top 10% and the bottom 10% of
  the society.

  Finnish taxes are high, and its tempting to avoid them. But people are
  shamed into paying tax. Do you really think it's a coincidence that
  Jorma Ollilla, Nokia CEO, knowing he will be published at the top of
  the list every year, pays the full whack of 60% tax? If you don't pay
  tax, not only will the tax office be after you. Everyone knows you
  haven't paid your fair share. Everyone knows. Your colleagues at work,
  your family, your neighbours, your kid's schoolteacher, the guy who
  serves you coffee in your favourite coffee shop. Try living with that.

<h3><a name="Ethicalvaluemetrics">Tue 18 Jul 2006 : Ethical value metrics</a></h3>
<pre>This metric reflects the expected increase in universal entropy caused
by the existence of an organism over the future course of the
universe compared to the organism not existing (or being killed, if
that is the question). Since this is usually uncomputable due to our
inability to predict the deep future in this way, we might (a) do some
sort of future discounting or modify the metric to (b) only include
the entropy increase of the universe for the expected duration of the
organisms life.

This metric ("m") is natural in several ways:

let A and B be individuals. Let everything else be equal between the
individuals unless otherwise stated and let us use the (b) metric unless
otherwise stated. Then the metric is natural is the sense that:

   1) if A lives longer than B, then m(A)>m(B)
   2) if A does more work / consumes more energy than B, without  
      stealing it from a more efficient consumer then m(A)>m(B)
   3) (if we're counting
      descendents too) if A has more offsping than B then m(A)>m(B)
   4) if A is bigger than B then generally 2) is implied
   5) if A does not kill capriciously, then m(A)>m(B)
   6) if A recycles waste and uses the extra energy then m(A)>m(B)
   7) if A does not "burn down the forests" without what most people
      consider good cause, then m(A)>m(B)
   8) descendents set up solar panels on mars or otherwise tap new  
energy
      sources: then m(A)>m(B)
   9) descendents spread out geographically, otherwise act the
      same: then m(A)>m(B)

<h3><a name="Laughter">Tue 18 Jul 2006 : Laughter</a></h3>
<p/>
Laughter is fear and relief. Fear is all around. Every step is  
conditioned by the fear of falling. It is the relief from primitive  
anxiety and alarm responses that give rise to laughter. The release  
of the breath that wasn't needed. That sudden surprise rendered  
harmless by higher perception. Wonder, when accompanied by the  
expression of laughter is the unknown and fearful transformed. A  
transformation by subconscious brain functions typically of sub  
second duration. A transformation that takes the unknown and  
therefore possibly lethal and yields up the unknown and harmless to  
observe. Something to be explored, understood and remembered by wide  
eyed curiosity. Those eyes wide to suck in the world and a memory  
hungry for its details. A psychological and physiological stance that  
makes the unknown known. A state of maximal observational learning.

<p/>
He was clean shaven, 20 kilos heavier and one year older, but he was
still Antony. The last time we met his slender build and long orange
hair & beard cast him as a modern Celtic Jesus. The last time we met he
believed he could see dark matter and emit ultra violet rays. The last
time we met he had cursed my evil heart and run off into the night. He
was my oldest friend in Australia and now found himself in the East
Ringwood mental health repatriation centre.
<p/>

One year ago I had received a phone call from Sydney where Antony was
visiting his sister. "Julian," he said, "I want to come and see you. I
want to talk about to you about Quantum Mechanics,". That's the way he
said it. Quantum Mechanics.
<p/>

I had met Antony when I was 14 when we were both in "hell", a school in
rural Victoria and one of 37 I'd attended on during my itinerant  
minstrel
childhood. We were bright sensitive kids who didn't fit into the
dominant subculture and feircely castigated those who did as iredeemable
boneheads.
<p/>

This unwillingness to accept the authority of a peer group considered
risible was not appreciated. I was quick to anger and brutal  
statements such
as <i>"You're a bunch of mindless apes out of Lord of the Flies"</i> when faced
with standover tactics were enough to ensure I got into a series of
extreme fights and I wasn't sorry to leave when presented with
the dental bills of my tormentors.
<p/>

Antony fared better. He wasn't new and had a social deftness that
allowed him to side step and keep his contempt hidden where mine exuded
from every pore. ``What is the most noble emotion Julian?'' he asked one
day. ``Curiosity,'' I said after some thought. ``No,''. he said,
``Anger.''
<p/>

<p/>
My journal from our last meeting contains the following entry:
<blockquote>
      Antony arrives from Sydney with girl in toe. A' Mid-length hair
      and beard, both carrot red. A' decked out in hippy attire. Strong
      contrast to previous 'tough man' image.  Newage fruitiness is now
      all consuming. A' attempting to dominate J' [brother]. A' can see
      "dark matter", emit UV rays, is a 15th (3*5) plane yogi, 27th dan
      Kung Foo Spirit Master. A' casts a voodoo spell "of death" on
      Michael B. by "cutting the throat" of my ceramic goose. A' clearly
      suffering some type of schizophrenia. V.  poor reality testing and
      is of unstable affect. Poor reality testing fuelled by reading of
      Calos Castenida, occult books, etc. Much worse compared to last
      observation circa 18 months ago, but perhaps madness (then) was
      concealed as hypochondria. Situation v. sad. Believe A' will be in
      mad house or dead within 5 years and tell him so...

But now he was at the East Ringwood mental health repatriation centre.
His smile was shaky but characteristic. His physical edges rounded off
by weight gain and his imagination dulled by anti-psychotics. His limbs
and jaw gently shuddered with some frequency. He still had his classical
guitar and chemistry books. His sensitivity and insight were not
completely gone. His diagnosis was paranoid schizophrenia with co-morbid
depression. The etiology (cause) of onset probably his drug synthesis
experiments combined with genetic susceptibility. His prognosis unknown.

<p/>
In his schizophrenic state he'd had phrases for the most subtle
feelings. He had challenged me to deny the reality of 'psyhic vampires'
-- those people look at you a certain way, trying to suck out your soul.
But I found myself stumbling. There were such people and psychic
vampires was a good phrase for them. He'd managed to push internal
feeling onto external perception and use the change in perception to
name the phenomena. But he'd turned up his gain so much feedback was
breaking out everywhere. During his schizophrenic state he'd given me a
gold metallic card and said with great earnestness ``Julian. I think the
fine lines on this card are picking up neutrinos from the 4-5 helium
cycle in the Sun. I'm sure it's getting heavier. Please take it to the
Dept of Physics to be weighed''.

<p/>
What delicacy there is in setting the controls on the amplifier of a
human being. In the right context the tiny energy carried by the snap of
a distant twig must be sufficient to cause immediate flight and a
billion fold liberation of energy. <i>An optimally perceptive brain must
always be near the critical point of activing in response to its own
internal noise.</i>

<p/>
When I asked about the cause of his shaking, suggesting a dopamine
antagonist, he said ``No. It's one of the other anti-psychotics. If you
look closely you'll notice a number of people around here acting the
same way. Julian... we're all doing the Mont Park shuffle''.

What do guitars, lollies, lipstick, tamagotchis, padded bras,
pornography, movies, opium, Ever Quest, and 98% of any Australian
newspaper in common? They are all technologies of emmotional
manipulation which distort our perceptions for the benefit of their
masters. Language centres in our neocortex may claim to "know" they
are fake, but these words only feebly suppress those primitive areas of
the brain which give rise to our feelings, colour our memories and
command our attention. These non-verbal processing regions of the  
brain have not
evolved to deal such sensory sophistry. For them, sensing <i>is</i>  
believing.
<p/>
Hence the feelings in a young woman's breast buffeted by the flashing
lights and impossibly sonorous tones of the amplified rock star; master
of a 20 KiloWatt Adam's apple and by inference a super man having the
chest cavity of God. Hence the dilated pupil of a man
glancing at skin tone pigments on matted wood
fibres, a pattern of vision that once meant love was not only in the air
but ready and willing, prostrate on the ground. Hence the wariness of
the horror movie attendee when returning home and opening the door of
what was, and infact still is, a pefectlty innocent closet. Hence
understanding
Neighbors instead of neighbors and having Friends instead of friends.
Hence the poker machine addict. Hence the dramatic rise in the economic
take of powerful industries built around using advances in technology to
stuff our heads with false feelings and memories. Not content to be zero
sum, in exchange for our wealth and time these industries generally
leave us less able to function by decalibrating our emotional and
intellectual repore with reality.
<p/>
"But, I like it you cold hearted Lutheran, you Stoic, you stone mason,
you Zeno loving stick in the mud!". Well naturally, since the whole game
is to manipulate your feelings, it is not suprising that you have
positive associations about your perceptual opium, is is, after all,  
what
keeps you going back to your dealer.
<p/>
Such deceptions, previously known as "Art", as in "Artifice" or
"Artful" have a long history of successful human parasitation. But the
industrial control of and rapid advances in the ability to successfully
falsify sense data has no historical analog. I have previously argued
that a possible explanation for the Fermi Paradox (why don't there seem
to be any aliens, dude) is the existence of a developmental ceiling
created by technological advances flowing into the perceptual
manipulation industry till it gobbles up through diversion and wealth
destruction all economic growth.

<p/>
The measurement paradox seems to be going away as people have filled in
the details on many worlds / environmental decoherence. This hasn't come
from arm chair philosophising so much as out of real modeling problems
from quantum computation. I don't understand this well enough yet to say
anything meaningful, but my five second take is that it does for the
measurement problem what entropy does for the arrow of time and in much
the same way; by denying an independent dimension to the phenomenon and
instead extrapolating it from the behavior of a statistically large
ensemble. The discussion is not purely philosophical, because you need
something like this if you want to think usefully about the behavior of
nano sized "measurement" devices. It's not that many worlds predicts
different results to Copenhagen, but that you can't think about some
quantum computation problems easily enough with Copenhagen to be able to
make a prediction at all. And here I give an analogy: All measurements
are rational numbers but physics is full of complex numbers. All you
ever do in physics is connect, through computers and brains one rational
number (settings on an experiment) to another (results of a
measurement). So why is physics full of complex numbers? Because they
permit us to out think those too pure to use them and here follows the
analogy; by the time any measurement gets into my brain it is in a form
that satisfies Copenhagen since it has interacted with a macro ensemble
(apparatus and my flesh) and likewise the setup of any macro experiment
satisfies Copenhagen. But in the middle we may use any consistent trick
that aids our thinking. The "tricks" are as real as their power to
produce predictions consonant with described reality, for this, in  
some sense is
the definition of understanding.

But this is mostly putting effect before cause, for surely it is the

<p />
Disagreement is a good spur for conversation, but I don't
know where to begin with your claim. People gain pleasure and power  
in spreading
certain beliefs and certain beliefs are easy to spread. They don't look
for the truth because they want to preserve this pleasure. Truth is
rarely
important in human affairs and if you want to shift your definition
the only truth is power over reality. But it
was
the will to truth pouring its acid over the false beauty of gods and  
kings
that
guided us out of the miasma of the dark ages. You are not stupid. You
are perfectly
capable of piercing your claim, but you choose not to, since, like most
people,
you'd prefer to please and deceive.
<p />
By 'you' I mean the entire ensemble, not merely that part which  
processes words.
To be human is to deceive. All human beings are great self deceivers,  
but this is not the innocent charm of the naively hopeful. They  
deceive themselves
so that they may deceive others and having tasted this pleasure  
return to lap at its fountain. See Gregory Bateman. Your belief in  
various
kinds of unsubstantiated newage hokey that you could easily shoot down
is a reflection of this underlaying tendency. How many times have you
read "But if we believe X then we'll have to...", or "If we believe X it
will lead to...". This has no reflection on the veracity of X and so we
see that outcomes are more important to most people than truth, which
should not be as a surprise, because natural selection selects on
physically realised existence, not on platonic ideals.
<p />
But then as we fall back into the miasma, the shadow world of ghosts
and distortions a miracle rises; everywhere before self interest is  
known,
people yearn to know where its compass points and then people hunger  
for the truth with
passion and beauty and insight. He loves me. He loves me not. Here then
the truth can set them free. Free from the manipulations and  
constraints of
the mendacious. Free to choose their path, to remove the ring from  
their noses,
to look up into the infinite voids and choose wonder over guilt. And  
before
this feeling to cast blessings on the profits and prophets of truth, the  
liberators and martyrs of truth, those
Voltairs, Galileo's, and Principia's of truth, those brutal driven  
obsessed miners of
reality, those serial killers of delusion smashing the whole rotten  
edifice till all ruins and the seeds of the new.

Seen Saturn's gossamer rings through a telescope? Yes? Then cast your

believed in
Saturn's rings but hadn't seen them. You agreed with others they existed
without doubt, perhaps even had posters on your wall listing their
properties or used the rings in passing analogy or to seduce a lover,
and if someone had turned to you and suggested that Saturn's rings were
a grand conspiracy, you would have chided them as a fool, but then when
your telescope was pointed at the bright golden star overhead and an
image formed in your mind out of photons _straight from Saturn_,  
something
changed, and your heart stirred your head to exclaim ``It's true then!
It really does have rings!''. Of course! But isn't this what you claimed
all along? How well you concealed your disbelief in Saturn's rings --
even from yourself! So to with your belief in the mendacity of the
state. True belief begins only with a jackboot at the door. True belief
forms when lead into the dock and referred to in the third person. True

The truth is not found on the page, but is a wayward sprite that 
bursts forth from the the readers mind for reasons of its own. I once 

thought that the Truth was a set comprised of all the things that 
were true, and the big truth could be obtained by taking all the 
little truth statements and evaluating them till nothing remained. I 
would approach my rhetorical battles as a logical reductionist, 
tearing down, atomisiing, proving, disproving, discarding falsehoods 
and reassembling truths till the Truth was pure and unarguable. But 
then when truth matters most, when truth is the agent of freedom, I 
stood before Justice and with truth, lost freedom. Here was something 
fantastical, you could show irrefutably that (A => B) and  (B => C) 

and (C => D) and Justice would agree, but then, when you claimed your 

coup de grace,  A => D <i>irrevocably</i>, Justice would shake its head

and revoke the axiom of transitivity, for Justice <i>will not be told</i>.

Transitivity is enabled when Justice decides for emotional reasons A 
=> D *feels nice*. What horror, here is the truth not as a bridge, 
sturdy to every step, a marvel of bound planks and supports from the 
known into the unknown, but a surging sea of smashed wood, flotsam 
and drowning sailors. So first the poetic metaphor, to make the 
reader want to believe, then the facts, and miracle, transitivity is 
evoked as justification for prejudice. <p />

<pre>There are no unarguable axioms of value or worth, there are only  
inclinations and my inclinations  have turned to an intense loathing  
of institutions, and most of the people in them; those spineless  
supplicants agape at the passing of other men's ideas, not drawn by  
desire, but driven by fear and ignorance, to the tepid hearth of  
institutionalism. One may argue as to the qualities of a passing man's
wife, but as a life philosophy it can only appeal to self-loathing  
celibates. How much better the subjective stance which curls the mind  
around the lovely creature in one's embrace!

This perception etched into me when I attended an Australian  
Institute of Physics conference at ANU with 900 career physicists,  
the body of which were snivelling fearful conformists of woefully,  
woefully inferior character. For every Feynman or Lorentz, 100 pen  
pushing wretches scratching each others eyes out in academic  
committees or building better bombs for the DSTO (Defence Science &  
Technology Organisation), who had provided everyone with a bag,  
embossed with their logo, which most physicists pathetically lugged  
about with pride and ignorance.

A year before, also at ANU, I represented my university at the  
Australian National Physics Competition. At the prize ceremony, the

<h3><a name="Practicalparticipatoryeconomics">Wed 12 Jul 2006 : Practical participatory economics</a></h3>
<pre>There is a foundation (herein called "the Institute") which holds
some of my copyrights and which I have used from time to time as a
front, gently concealing my freedom from the social covenant. There are
activities that the Institute should engage in that require substantial
cash reserves.  Normally NGOs beg, but I'm no good at that sort of
thing, so the the Institute has created an offshore startup company
("thing2thing.com") to fund it.

This little seed has pushed through into the light from the dark loam
wherein ideas are born and now calls for gardeners and manure.  To supply
them the Institute will pool auction off 40% of the company over two
months (i.e angel investors get their investment / total investment of
the 40% auctioned) to anyone who will invest. There's no higher reason
for this approach, it is a method of gaining initial funding.

There are two dilemmas (di-lemma = "two truths". 2 dilemmas = 4 truths).

The investment. It is a great blessing to have courage and foresight that
results in wealth producing rather than wealth destroying acts. However
foresight is limited and the connection between dividends and the
intelligence of the original investment, assuming there ever was one,
slowly dwindles to zero, whittled away by fate's unrelenting peturbations
of man's activities; above this plunging donkey, dividend payments
may soar exponentially till they yearn for the Islamic opprobrium on
unearned wealth.  Now this very possibility, this pleasant vision of
pocketing of the dividend fatwa, increases investment without increasing
investment discrimination unless some investments can be seen to exclude
this eventuality.

Dilemma#1

There is thought of engineering investments so that after a substantial
return, dividends are transformed into a donation to the Institute
or some other charity, but this will reduce total investment, perhaps
resulting in a net evil, since we define the Institute's ability to act
as a good. Examining the extremes, we see immediately that if the company
makes nothing, the Institute makes less than nothing and the investors
make less than nothing while if the investors receive substantial unearned
wealth, then the Institute is well funded and able to act. But wealth
flows from the ongoing daily labors of those running the startup. Here
we see the disparity. Their labor is ongoing and connected to wealth
production at all times. Individuals who start companies try to minimise
share dilution while maximising investment. While larger companies
will sell bonds or borrow at market rates, startups succeed in attracting
investors to their roulette table by offering the carnal vision of
l'amour without l'commitment. Can we reinvent the bordello? This brings
me to the next dilemma.

Dilemma#2

How should employees, if that word is not too psychologically confining,
be compensated for their time and abilities?  ''anyway they want to be''
for supply and demand works for novel compensation schemes just as it
works for traditional wages. So my question becomes, 'given that the
founders loathe paperwork & consensus and need to satisfy investors that
their investment isn't going to be entirely returned in form of employee
stock options, what is left to offer employees? How can their hearts be
opened to the new?' </pre>

But every association relates two objects both ways. She started drinking more and more coffee.

It's a non-issue. Google, yahoo and many, many others use linux servers,
built with linux tools.

There's no clear definition as to where a program begins and ends. Is
the configuration file part of a program? Its interface with system
libraries? Information flows all around inorder for anything to have an
affect on the world. 'program' is ill defined, since there is no way to
decide what is in the set and what isn't other than the law courts, but
the political and legal will is such that many giants must fall before
you do. Technical people, good at stacking houses of abstract cards
often look at the law and see rules, but this is a shadow, for law hangs
from the boughs of politics, that branch of behavior involved with the
societal control of freedom of action. Always consider the real politik

Tiki Swain, is Science Works demonstrator. Science Works has a lightning generator, a 2 million volt Tesla coil, a very noisy and impressive machine. She writes:
<blockquote>
So I've asked the question "What is lightning?". Usually I get the older kids (who've learnt a few things at school) saying "Electricity", "static electricity", "electric current", "a flow of electric charges". And younger kids say things like "It's a bright light", "a bolt from the sky", "it happens in a storm", "it's a light that comes with a big bang". This time, I got emotive/experiential words - very unusual. I'd ask what lightning was, and they'd say "It's scary". "It's loud". "It's exciting". "It's noisy". 
</blockquote>
<p />
The younger children's descriptions are powerful, communicatable phenominological descriptions of nature. The older children's
descriptions are useless, unexperienced rules that they've learnt to
regurgitate. One may as well say 'God makes it go'. And that is preceicely the point, <i>authority makes it go</i>.
<p />
By being an adult asking for a question to which she obviously already
knew the answer, she had given them some kind of regurgitation
context. The older children give answers that fit
social expections not answers that are meaningful --- because the social
expectation <i>is</i> to produce meaningless answers! The younger children are
not yet sophisticated enough at understanding social context so reveal what they really think i.e something with predictive and
descriptive power.
<p />
Why do things fall to earth? Answering 'gravity' only tells you about a rule
human beings have agreed on. The rule is, when asked why stuff falls
one should reply with the word 'gravity' and not, say 'love' or 'God'. But it is 
a pleasure to say that apples 'love' planets just as much as planets
'love' apples and that 'love' fades with inverse square distance. Ah huh!
There is your true content, it's the predictive description of behavior in the last
part of the sentence, which we may call anything we wish. The younger children describe the behavior of the
natural world. The older children describe the behavior of society
alone. They're not stupid. They know their survival depends on saying the right thing, at all possible times to people in power.

One of the devout was the lovely daughter of a New Castle minister.
At some point in my unintended wooing of her, she looked up, fluttered
her eyelids and said 'Oh, you know so much! I hardly know anything!'.
'That is why you believe in God," I explained.  This conversational
brutality took her breath away and she swooned. I was exactly what she
secretly longed for; a man willing to openly disagree with her father. All
along she had needed a man to devote herself to. All along she had failed

underclass are victims in waiting. The force of their action is in
inverse proportion to the perception that the victim's father may be an
influential lawyer or have contacts in the political classes that
control them.

The anonymisation of peoples through high population density strips
state victims of retributive power; in small communities, "you beat my
son" is soon followed by "your cousin shall not marry my daughter". The
anonymous megaloposis denies this kind of retribution.

Additional freedom is granted alone to the trikster, who through
adopting the manner and dress of the establishment may fool the agents
of the state into deference.

In full circle, every so often a member of the establishment, foolish
enough to believe that power was within, puts on their bathers, or their
sweat suit and becomes a victim. The grunts protest... "we didn't think
you were the man; you weren't dressed right. it's not our fault. you
must play by the rules.".

From Tiki Swain:

On the scene - 1818, Wednesday 21 June 2006

As I walk out onto the platform at Newport Train Station, I hear a
woman's voice, upset but calming. She's telling someone to let them do
it, it'll be OK. I look over to the far platform, across two sets of
tracks. In the open-front waiting room a man is seated on the bench
having his arm twisted up over his shoulder and behind his back by two
other men. He's resisting. The two men handling him are nondescript, in
casual clothing - both beefy, both in clothes that show wear and use,
but that's all they have in common visually. The woman speaking stands
outside, pacing back and forth, talking constantly. "Love, it's all
right. We'll work it out. It'll be ok. I don't know who they are. They
haven't told us anything. It'll be OK, just let them handcuff you. They
just want to ask you some questions. Just stay calm."

Sure enough, the two men have somehow produced handcuffs from somewhere.
They now have the first man facing the wall, held down, and are trying
to handcuff his hands behind his back. A second woman stands outside,
looking down the platform, glancing in every so often, talking steadily
and inaudibly into a walkietalkie. She is also carrying no identifying
marks or badges, wearing nondescript casual clothing - flared boot-
topper jeans, a jacket with some random brand slogan. There is nothing
to show that she has any association with the men other than her
proximity and her walkietalkie - not a normal civilian carry item.

"It'll be OK. Just let them do it. I don't know who they are. They're
just going to find out what you know. It can't be much, maybe a $500
fine. You haven't done anything illegal or broken the law or anything.
They'll take you down to the station. It'll take only two hours or so.
Just two hours, and we'll come and get you. It's OK, we'll come and get
you. Just sit down now."

I wonder to myself how she knows how long a station visit takes, and how
she knows they're going to "a station" if she still doesn't know who
they are. I wonder if she comprehends the various levels of law involved
in the conflicting statements "you haven't broken the law" and "only a
$500 fine". I wonder what happened in the sixty seconds before I walked
through the platform door.

She asides (at the same volume) to the other woman "I'm just trying to
keep him calm". Her voice is not angry, not shrill - but definitely
upset and slightly panicky. She knows she doesn't know what's happening,
and that none of the three are saying anything to her or giving any
explanation. Inside the waiting room they've now moved to the other
wall, and are now holding the man out of my sight. She looks back in at
them and starts quickly saying "Give him some fresh air! You've got to
let him come outside! He needs fresh air!". She gestures frantically but
frustratedly with her arms, waving her lit cigarette across the entrance
as she does so.

It seems a pointless thing to say - they don't appear to be taking any
notice of her as long as she's not hindering them. But then the two men
bring out the first, handcuffed. He doesn't walk well. "What did you hit
him with? Was it mace?" she says. "Was it pepper spray? Why did you have
to do that? You didn't need to do that!" The two men lead the third into
the male toilets, out of sight. The woman follows them partway, then
comes back out, sobbing. "That's police brutality! All he did was jump
onto the tracks!" She's making no attempt to be soothing now that she's
not in front of them, letting her upset fully show, and it's not clear
who she's talking to. Perhaps just all of us watching silently on both
platforms. Walkie-talkie woman holds in place, walking a few steps up
and down the platform, keeping the device horizontal to her ear and
mouth, talking steadily, not watching the men.

The upset woman dashes into the waiting room, to a corner out of sight,
and comes out carrying a collection of bags and bits, their gear. She
calls out to her partner in that same calming voice again "It'll be OK.
I'll find out where they're taking you and we'll get you." She
approaches the woman and says in the same clear medium volume as
everything else she's said: "Excuse me, where are you taking him? I need
to know because I need to ring his dad and tell him, he was going to
pick us up at the station." The walkietalkie woman looks past her, eyes
on space and ears on the walkie talkie. The first woman comes closer.
"Excuse me, lady, I need to talk to you. Please." She says it calmly and
straightforwardly, with no rudeness or aggression. She is ignored. She
repeats herself, and continues to be ignored. Walkietalkie woman is
following one of the simple rules of enforcing submission - do not
engage. Do not give any action, speech or emotion power by acknowledging
it exists. Do not act in any way which encourages them to think they can
make a difference to your actions.

It works. The first woman returns to her stuff, obviously waiting for a
chance to speak with anyone. She intersperses her fretful pacing and
cigarette waving with random callings out to her partner. "It'll be OK."
"They'll just take you to the station."  "It won't take long." One of
the men returns from the toilets, carrying an open notebook, and asks
her if she has any ID. She says "No, but my partner does." The two of
them begin speaking more quietly. I overhear a lone phrase - "We were
running to try and catch the train...". She goes into the toilets with
him, and almost immediately dashes out again and grabs a lone shoe from
the pile of stuff. "It's OK, love, I've got your shoe. Here's your
shoe." She goes in again. The only one left visible is walkietalkie
woman, listening intently to the far away voices. She begins to speak
again, but puts an arm over her lower face, hiding her mouth.

The Flinders St train pulls in in front of me, and I don't/can't see any
more. Instead I catch the train onwards, wondering. Wondering if I'd
feel trusting if I was being manhandled by two of three unmarked
unknowns. Wondering at the logic of "let them put the handcuffs on you"
combined with "We don't know who they are". Wondering what he did to
elicit this response.

I think about the people on the platforms, who in their behaviour assume
that everything is meant to happen this way, this is all orderly and
expected, who assume that these three unknowns are official and that
they are responding to a fellow passenger this way because he did
something that deserved it.

And I think about the woman most of all. I wonder at the trust in our
society that she's displaying by assuming he is being taken to a
station, or is it hope? and her assuming that a station visit is
something he will return from, unharmed, in a relatively short time. I
consider the luxury of living in a society where people can make those
assumptions, have those hopes. I wonder at her implicit belief in voice,
in wording and in behaviour that playing the system and supporting it
fully is the best method for survival, even when she's not sure which
bit of the system they've fallen afoul of. Sort of an adult version of
the child's belief in the sanctity of goodness - that bad things will
not happen to you if you are good. I note that she never spoke angrily
or aggressively to any of the three unknowns, or even unleashed the full
extent of her feelings at them. And I wonder at this apparent
belief/behaviour that intelligent reason will bring them through,
eventually. I wonder at this latter because it's such a great belief of
our society, yet I've never considered it true by fact, only true by
mutual agreement. It only lasts until someone disagrees.

<h3><a name="Mosheandtheglasseye">Thu 22 Jun 2006 : Moshe and the glass eye</a></h3>
<p/>
Sometimes my eyes are lovingly full of Eastern European tradegy.
The surest escape from the mundane is to teleport into the tragic
realm. To topple kings someone must die. One soon revels in the carnage
of change; whatever flowers grow at the end of Lear or Hamlet we know they
blossem into a different world, stronger for the corpses under their roots.

<p/>
This tradition is still alive in the Ukraine, the bread basket and basket
case of 20th century Europe. Within in the life span of a working school
master the Ukraine saw Stalin's genocidal collectivisation of the Kulaks
and subsequent mass famine, the NKVD terror of 1937, the 1943 Axis rout
of soviet forces and subsequent Weirmacht control, another round of
crop distruction, SS extermination of the Slavs, scorched earth Axis
widthdrawl, gradual Warsaw Pact repression and bureaucratization,
and then, in homage to the Gnostic view of God, the 1986 Chernobyl
catastrophe just outside of Kiev (see http://www.kiddofspeed.com).

<p/>
Man must suffer constraint to write, for a man with a gun needs no
thought, but the prison state gives its citizens nothing but thoughts.
Before words on paper, there must be words in the head, that that
plaintive, demanding upwelling of reason that takes the place of action
because the environment has action constrained.  Where words have the
power to change, the state tries hard to trap, burn, or blank them, such
is its fear of their power.  <i>But where words are emasculated before birth,
where words are powerless playings, smothered, half drowned kittens,
scrabbling for someone, anyone to hold them, the state is fearless and
words like birds, bees and other creatures of no political consequence
are free.</i>

Now I offer you the following based on a tale of my grandfather's,
which I have taken to using as a filter of men; women do not seem to
feel it, being too full of future life to enjoy the austere bleakness
of concentration camp sarcasm.

<blockquote>
	Moshe shuffled in the prisoner selection line with his
	daughter. When he came to the selection guard Moshe was told both
	father and daughter would be sent either to the extermination
	camp or the work camp. The guard found their numbers and said the
	daughter was go to the extermination camp. Moshe wailed, fell to
	the ground and threw his arms about the guard's legs, begging for
	his daugther to be spared. He kissed the guard's boots and offered
	his own life and the extraction of the last of his gold teeth.
	The guard smiled thinly and said, "Very well, but first you must
	pass my test. My eyes are completely indistinguishable from each
	other but are not the same. One is glass and was modeled on the
	other. Reichsmarshal Goering himself appointed the finest jewelers
	in Potsdam to craft it after I returned from the front. If you
	can find a way to distinguish the glass eye from the real one,
	I will trade your life for your daughter's". Moshe starred into the
	guard's eyes and slowly raised his hand, pointing to the left eye.
	The guard looked at Moshe and shouted, "What! How did you know?!".
	"I am sorry.. " trembled Moshe, "but the left eye looks at me
	with a kindly gleam".

  Psychology of bad probability estimation: why lottos and terrorists matter
<p />
Here's the audio from a South By Southwest 2006 presentation by
Harvard's Daniel Gilbert on the psychology of probability estimation.
This is important stuff -- it explains why we're socially willing to
commit nigh-infinite social resources to fighting terrorism, though
statistically, terrorist attacks almost never happen; though we barely
lift a finger to help save people from routine traffic accidents,
backyard pool drownings, and asthma, which mow down our neighbors by the
thousands. It explains why people buy lottery tickets. It explains a
great deal about many kinds of human activity. This is both sensible and
entertaining audio, and it's got a great title: "How to Do Precisely the
Right Thing at All Possible Times."

<h3><a name="NetBSDfoundationMembershipAgreement">Sun 18 Jun 2006 : NetBSD foundation Membership Agreement</a></h3>
It has run space probes and ocean liners, it's in every recent Apple Macintosh and runs and most of the Internet including the site you are reading now. <a href="http://www.netbsd.org">NetBSD</a> and its decendents <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>, <a href="http://www.openbsd">OpenBSD</a> and <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a>. The NetBSD Foundation (TNF) required those people involved in its creation (committers -- coders with more than usual control over the project) to sign a legal contract by June 2006. As far
as such documents go, it is not too draconian, but I felt it was the antithesis of what motivated me to be involved with the foundation (building something out of the love of creation and intellectual competition). It lacked
spirit. I refused to sign, effectively resigning. I think these projects are "complete"; still a vital force behind global cognition, but like the telephone or the transistor, most creative effort is now going into making them faster or asking what colour they should be:
<p />
I understand the real politik behind this, namely, quelling fears of
companies that productize NetBSD and perhaps personal liability fears of
the TNF board members, but I think this is the wrong way to go about it.
<p />
We create the state through our actions and language. TNF through its
contract document recreates the malfeasant corporate state within our
programmer world. TNF should protect and nurture its committers, not ask
them to fall on their swords at the first sign of danger. Limited
liability as an organizational concept arose inorder to encourage
investment. If TNF has any legal use, it is to sheild committers from
TNF's actions, not the other way about.
<p />
IF the legal threat in the US is real and not a nightmare of the
fearful, then TNF copyright and cvs should be moved to an offshore
jurisdiction, of which there are many available that do not have US
style patent or copyright law. The US node can be used to promote
activities in the US and its Limited Liability can protect the board
members in the role of those activities.
<p />
The contract as well as being an instrument of the state is
written in the demeaning language of the corporate state. It should have
been written in the language of our programmer world. 
Even in the world
of the state it is not clear that the contract is valid, given that
committers seem to give away rights and services to TNF but do not
receive compensation from TNF in doing so.
<p />
I haven't committed for several years, so my refusal may mean little,
but I encourage others to keep NetBSD a place of people united in
creation, a place of collective defense for our programmer world,
where bullshit is directed out, not in.

<h3><a name="Whatarerightsanyway?">Sun 18 Jun 2006 : What are rights anyway?</a></h3>

<p/>
Rights are freedoms of action that are known to be enforceable.
Consequently there are no rights without beliefs about the future
effects of behavior. Unenforcable general rights exist only insofar as
they are argumentation that may one day yield enforcement.

<p/>
Hence the Divine Right of Kings, the right of way, mining rights,
conjugal rights, property rights, and copyright.

<p/>
The decision as to what should be enforced and what may be ignored is
political. This does not mean that rights are unimportant, but rather,
that <i>politics (the societal control of freedom) is so important as to
subsume rights.</i>
<p/>
Politics emerges as the expression of the battle between our
collective desires and strenghts. Due to the common nature of mankind,
there is great commonality in some of our strongest desires. When these
desires do not compete they drive politics forward to ensure their
forfillment. This is what we usually mean by the capitalised Right,
a powerword, a threat of collective enforcement.

<h3><a name="Climateskepticismpatterns">Thu 08 Jun 2006 : Climate skepticism patterns</a></h3>
<pre>Recently I've run across a couple of presentations on technological
solutions to reverse global warming.  The most interesting is to put
stuff into the upper atmosphere to block UV light.  Not only does this
reduce warming due to sunlight, it has an immediate payoff in terms of
reduction in skin cancer.  Analyses suggests that it would actually pay
for itself in terms of just that effect, independent of the benefits
for climate change.

Here is one presentation, a 7-minute audio interview with UCI physicist
(and science fiction author) Greg Benford:

http://www.desmogblog.com/gregory-benford-podcast
(http://www.desmogblog.com/audio/download/310)

And here is a paper by Dr. Edward Teller of Livermore Labs on the subject,
which I think is the work Benford is referring to:

http://www.llnl.gov/global-warm/
http://www.llnl.gov/global-warm/148012.pdf

Teller's paper actually describes two mitigation schemes, one involving
putting stuff in the stratosphere, and the other a more ambitious plan
to station material at the Earth-Sun L1 point.  This is a semi-stable
orbital point approximately a million miles towards the Sun from the
Earth.  Teller et al calculate that only 3000 tons of smart material
located at L1 would diffract away enough sunlight from Earth to eliminate
global warming.  Of course it will be some time before we can put or
manipulate this much material in space.

Benford suggests (in his interview) beginning a pilot scheme to put 100
micron particles into the arctic stratosphere during the summer, in order
to try to reverse the loss of arctic sea ice and save the polar bears.
By design (and in fact, it's hard to avoid) these would snow out every
year so they have to be replaced each summer, at an annual cost of about
$100 million, he estimates.

The bottom line is, as Benford notes, "we're going to have to run this
planet."  Sooner or later the message will sink in that Kyoto and other
conservation efforts are too little, too late (and too expensive).
Geo-engineering will be forced on the human race, luddites and all,
by the climate change threat of the 21st century.
