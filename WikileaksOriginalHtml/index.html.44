			<p>As I write this, much of the international media is consumed with WikiLeaks&rsquo; gradual publication of a quarter-million US diplomatic reports. Why? Well first off, everyone likes to be let in on a secret, and if that secret involves acronyms like CIA, RAW, MI6, or ISI, the sexiness quotient skyrockets. That&rsquo;s more or less just human nature. But the reports also provide grist for media publications&mdash;especially European ones&mdash;always eager to spread some dirt about the Americans. London&rsquo;s <em>Guardian</em>, Madrid&rsquo;s <em>El Pais</em> and Paris&rsquo;s <em>Le Monde</em> were fairly salivating as the documents&rsquo; release date approached, and wrote with near-orgasmic prose once publication began. Their behaviour, too, was more or less predictable.</p>
<p>But the whirlwind around this batch of WikiLeaks leaks seems to point to a deeper concern among the public, one that stems from the increasing distance between the international reality they see and what their leaders describe to them. In recent years, the US public has had to hear its leaders repeatedly tell Americans that black was white: President Clinton said he didn&rsquo;t know Monica (in the biblical sense) or who attacked the USS Cole in Yemen; President George W. Bush said Saddam was a WMD threat and then that there was no insurgency in Iraq; and President Barack Obama has said we are winning in Afghanistan, jihad is self-improvement (like stopping alcohol consumption) and that Indonesia is a model of sectarian tolerance. The latter is a particularly remarkable black-is-white moment&mdash;there have been times in Indonesia in recent years when you probably could have turned off your car lights and driven safely at night by the illumination provided by burning Christian churches.</p>
<p>This sort of regular and routine deceit has increased the suspicion of Americans&mdash;and I&rsquo;d bet the suspicion of other nations&rsquo; publics, too&mdash;that they are being lied to about the conduct of governmental affairs. As a result, Americans seem to have become ever more eager to examine illegally acquired and disclosed &lsquo;secret&rsquo; information in the hope of finding out what&rsquo;s really going on.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s recent diplomatic trip through Asia&mdash;and especially his visit to India&mdash;is a very good example of an exercise so counterintuitive to the average observer, and so counterproductive to US interests, that one can only assume the real goal of the sojourn has intentionally been buried deep in highly classified messages not meant to be seen by the average citizen.</p>
<p>Preparing to leave Washington as the US-led war effort in Afghanistan is verging on collapse, Obama made clear that he wouldn&rsquo;t visit Pakistan. Whatever one thinks of Pakistan&rsquo;s track record as an ally, the truth is that the logistical viability of the US-NATO Afghan war effort depends on Pakistan keeping open overland supply routes from Karachi and Peshawar into Afghanistan. It also depends on Pakistan&rsquo;s military doing something to hurt al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in the border area, or at least not doing much to help them. These two facts alone, one would think, would have merited a day&rsquo;s visit to Islamabad to protect vital US interests. So why didn&rsquo;t they? I can&rsquo;t think of a reason.</p>

It was a great pity that Obama failed to take notice of human rights abuses in Kashmir by the Indian State.<br />
The Indian press seems to be going gaga over the supposedly diplomatic triumph for India (including the US First Lady&#8217;s bollywood dance skills). This should really serve as a reality check to decision-makers in New Delhi about the fate of their (mis)adventures in Afghanistan and Balochistan, once the US packs up and leaves.</p>

		<div class="comment-text"><p>The analysis is right. At a time when the US are really dependant from Pakistan on 4 issues (Aghanistan of course, but also international opium/drugs and terrorism networks, reinforcing the US position on the East of Iran, and to negotiate the Cashemire issue), we cannot understand how counter-productive the US attitude has been towards Islamabad, during this visit to India. The emergency is to keep Pakistan&#8217;s politicians cooperative enough, and in parallel to make progresses on the front of the Cashemire territorial dispute. Nothing of that was -apparently- achieved by the US administration during that last visit to India. In other words, this was for the global diplomacy &#8216;un coup d&#8217;epee dans l&#8217;eau&#8230;&#8217;</p>

		<div class="comment-text"><p>Indians will be rightly offended by his views, but the real problem with his argument is the following:</p>
<p>1. Michael seems to believe that Washington should view India solely through the prism of the conflict in Afganisthan. The US, wisely, doesn&#8217;t do that. The US is trying to build a long run strategic relationship with India which goes much beyond the current military entanglments of the US in Afganisthan. So, USA needs Pakistan for tactical reasons (fighting the war in Afganisthan) whereas the partnership with India is wide-ranging and spans significant commerce, people-to-people exchanges, military and strategic/political components. </p>
<p>2. The Pakistani Army uses the &#8220;India threat&#8221; as an excuse to justify their stranglehold on Pakistani society/economy/politics. Even if progress is made on Kashmir, they are not going to change their position. Given how useful the India threat has proved to be for the Pakistani Army, they are not going to give up that argument. In fact, they control Paksitan&#8217;s India policy and they don&#8217;t want significant improvements in the bilateral relationship, because that would mean their own power may diminish. </p>
<p>3. India is the only stable pluralistic democracy in the entire region. Muslims are legally not second class citizens in India. The American philospher Martha Nussbaum at University of Chicago has argued that the Indian Constitution protects religious liberty more effectively than the US constitution. Of course, discrimination against minorities is a significant problem, as many Indians would be happy to acknowledge. But that is a problem that exists in many societies, including democratic ones. The important thing is that these problems can be discussed frankly in Indian media/civil society. It is hard to think of ANY Muslim country that does better in protecting minority rights than India.</p>

		<div class="comment-text"><p>I can’t call Michael an insane, a fool or stupid. I have no words to describe this CIA’s  (Agent) Head of Bin Laden unit, let only American people say what ever they want to for the simple reason as a head of Bin Laden unit if he doesn’t know or believe that Bin Laden is hiding in Pakistan under the shelter of Pakistan Army why he or American might couldn’t trace Bin laden and still if Michael supports  Generals of Pakistan then he is just like his Government fooling American people at large. Ultimately, he is an Agent so he works for his Master who so ever it is. If he thinks he has written an excellent article for American people I am sure they will deal with it and some have already responded by saying that “I firmly believe, the failure of the American foreign policies over the years have been due to the reliance of Pentagon on uninformed ex CIA agents and diplomats like Michael Scheuer. These are the very people who are being exposed by Wikileaks, and we are seeing the duplicity and deceit these guys have inflicted on the American public.”<br />
Let me say one thing when we say America or India we mean American or Indian Government. I can very surely say that Indian Govt. doesn’t mean Indian people at large. For example when India was in Russian camp it doesn’t mean Indian people were loving Russia or when American policy was and is Pro Pakistan and anti India, Indian people were not loving America (i.e. American people or society in general). Indians have been loving America and rushing for American Universities, business and H1B or Green cards. This love is due to honest, free and frank society where outwardly no one is persecuted or restricted in career for color, cast and creed etc.  Now in India at least we know that our Government fools us and push in one camp of other (at one stage our Prime Minister was one of the founding member of third camp called Non alignment movement which was a pity) due to 37% people below poverty line, lack of education due to poverty etc. and still we say and practice biggest Democracy in the world.  However we (not just in India but world over) think Americans are highly educated knowledgeable and dead honest people so the Government they elect also must be similar. Wikileaks has proved that Indians (middleclass educated)  were very correct about perception of their Govt  but it has also brought to the fore that American Government is also same and not just the Obama administration but successive Governments. I don’t know when the legacy of George Washington died that he couldn’t speak a lie. At this stage I would only say that Michael Scheuer’s message that “Only Wikileaks can save (us ?) US Policy” should be taken seriously by American people.  Michael hardly knows Hindu history society and his tired against India can be dealt separately.</p>

<p>You wrote &#8211;<br />
&#8220;With no ‘Islamic’ Security Council seat mentioned by Obama (or indeed any other major world leader), the Muslim world will continue to believe that the UN is evolving in a markedly anti-Islamic direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>My reply &#8211;<br />
&#8220;What do you mean by Islamic world?? 10.3% of the total muslim population are Indians. that is roughly equal to the 11.3% population in pakistan. Indian muslims are always ready to defend India. The Indian army defends the LOC under the leadership of a Muslim general.&#8221;</p>
<p>You wrote &#8211;<br />
&#8220;Obama has put the US government on record as approving a Security Council seat for polytheistic Hindu India.&#8221;</p>
<p>My reply &#8211;<br />
&#8220;Polytheistic Hindu India &#8211; Its DEMOCRATIC SECULAR INDIA where muslims, hindus, christains, sikhs, buddhists live as brothers and sisters. Of course we have our internal conflicts but we will resolve it internally. Haven&#8217;t you read about the high court verdict on Ayodhya and the way Indians accepted it without any major disturbances.&#8221;</p>
<p>You wrote &#8211;<br />
&#8220;Indian society that positions Muslims as second-class citizens who lag significantly behind in education, income, life expectancy and access to higher education and government employment, and who also are confronted by a limited but virulent anti-Muslim Hindu nationalist movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>My reply &#8211;<br />
&#8220;Are writing this from some other planet? A boy from a very poor muslim family rose to become a famous scientist and went on to become the President of India. By the way he was made as a President of India under the regime of a political party called BJP(in your words &#8220;anti-muslim hindu nationalist movement&#8221;). Another muslim man is the most famous CEO in India. A sikh is our current prime minster and a catholic Italian lady is the president of the ruling coalition. I can quote thousand examples here. India provides ample amount oppurtunities for the minorities. Tonnes of reservations in jobs and education for minorities. What else you want??&#8221;</p>
<p>Please open your mind and read facts before writing an article.</p>

		<div class="comment-text"><p>There is a difference between Islamic Pakistan ( the Nucleus of Terrorism ) and Secular India (the largest democracy in the world ). There is a reason why Obama did not visit Pakistan and why he went to India&#8230; read on</p>
<p>I believe the pro-pakistan author does not know that Wikileaks had leaked info. about Pakistan&#8217;s government and ISI agency&#8217;s support for Taliban and Al-Qaeda ? US government is giving billions to Pakistan to fight Terrorism, but instead Pakistan ISI is training and preparing terrorists to fight against USA, India, and the world. Is Pakistan and their leaders to be praised or punished for these actions ?  Many journalists wrote about this secret relationship but only Wikileaks exposed and confirmed this with official documents.  </p>
<p>Remember, Pakistan&#8217;s nuclear scientist Mr. Khan was pardoned by Mr. Musharaff for giving away nuclear secrets to Iran.  Mr. Khan is considered a Hero of Pakistan for giving away nuclear secrets to an Islamic country like Iran to mass murder millions of infidels!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame that India&#8217;s 1.2 billion people has no permanent UN representation, but China a communist country is a permanent member of UN !  No wonder UN is loosing respect and authority because it is ruled by power and not by people. </p>
<p>Barack Obama did a right thing of not going to Pakistan because Pakistan has yet to prove that they are seriously doing the job of fighting terrorism.  Pakistan is a nucleus of terrorism. One reason Pakistan will never fully support anti-terrorism effort is because Pakistan needs these huge number of terrorists to fight against India and the infidels around the world.</p>
<p>If there is no terrorism, then Pakistan will loose billions of US dollars in free aid and world attention !  Pakistan is a beggar who keeps on begging money and weapons. Pakistan will generally capture or kill few innocents and make it look like they had killed terrorists before sending Pakistan president to USA on a beggar trip.  US pleased with the news will hand few millions and weapons in Pakistan&#8217;s portfolio for doing a wonderful job in fighting terrorism. </p>
<p>The F-16&#8217;s fighter planes are not needed to fight terrorists in Pakistan but they are desperately needed to deliver nuclear bombs on India.  Despite of this fact, foolish US sold F-16 fighters to Pakistan.  Sell weapons and wars to boost economy seems like a modern motto around the world. The world will be at a very high risk if Pakistan falls in the hands of terrorists or a military coup and these same nuclear weapons could be used against USA or Israel, instead of India !</p>
<p>Simply, President Obama&#8217;s recent trip was as a salesperson to sell weapons, airplanes, cars, medicine, and few goods.  USA gives weapons and many products FREE of charge to Pakistan in the name of friendly ally to fight terrorism, so there was no reason for him to go to Pakistan because he will not sell anything there that will bring money into US economy.</p>
<p>So given the facts President Obama did the right thing for not going to Pakistan and rightfully nominating India for a permanent UN seat.</p>

		<div class="comment-text"><p>The realization has sunk in that the war in Afghanistan is lost.<br />
Well, not really lost as in terms of suffering a huge military defeat but lost in the sense that it cannot be won. Therefore, in order to contain muslem ambitions, stronger ties with India are sought, also in the light of China emerging.<br />
Since the end of the cold war, US foreign policy evolved around dominating Eurasia. That&#8217;s why there were Golf War I and II, US involvement in the Balkan wars (siding with Sarajevo), the campaign for Iran. But Afghanistan is just too much. Empires were destroyed in Afghanistan, go ask the Russians and the Brits.<br />
Eurasia can still be contained but from a distance, by having a stronger alliance with India.</p>

		<div class="comment-text"><p>I firmly believe, the failure of the American foreign policies over the years have been due to the reliance of Pentagon on uninformed ex CIA agents and diplomats like Michael Scheuer. These are the very people who are being exposed by Wikileaks, and we are seeing the duplicity and deceit these guys have inflicted on the American public. With guys like these embedded in America&#8217;s decision making, you don&#8217;t need any external enemies! With such people dictating your foreign policies, how could have hoped for better outcomes in Vietnam, Iraq or now Afghanistan? </p>
<p>In effect this article makes out that the writer is more comfortable with America supporting a terrorist state that blackmails Americans to ensure the continued flow of aid of billions of dollars to keep fighting a losing war in Afghanistan. I can&#8217;t understand this logic at all. American&#8217;s should take an audit of the losses suffered by them in Pak-Afg even as Pakistan utilised the American aid to reinforce their terror machines and make it a deadly weapon against the American people. All along, as an ally of America, Pakistan has been hunting with the Americans and running with the Taliban. That was plain enough for all to see, but to agents like this writer.</p>
<p>Like any intelligent people, Indian&#8217;s were always aware of this ignorance and duplicity of American government, so Wikileaks is not much of a surprise to all of us here in India. There is nothing new that we are learning about the failed terror state and it&#8217;s designs with American support. Unfortunately, American intelligence is often late in understanding the culture of the fundametalist state &#8211; because of self serving agents like the writer. </p>
<p>I would request Americans to see through this game. Today, India really does not really need America. America was not there for us when we needed you most. In all humility, you need us more today &#8211; believe me you. Five years from now, if America flourishes, it will be because of the decisions you take today, because things are looking pretty bad for you today. I am sure, Americans would not be happy to be in a uncosy club of failed states like Pakistan, which is getting deeper into the mire every single day! Wisely, your earlier uppopular President Bush and the current one, President Obama are trying to reverse the trend for the good of everyone. I am sure they are on the right track.</p>

		<div class="comment-text"><p>Mr Schauer,</p>
<p>Your article seems to only have a tactical view of the world, missing the strategic detail that against a rising China in the new century, the US needs India as a counterweight, not Pakistan. Your article seems to suggest continued appeasement of China, and continued support of the generals in Pakistan. The latter is again a shortsighted tactical view of how Pakistan should be &#8211; military led- rather than disavowing the generals who suppress democratic institutions in Pakistan.  Did it ever occur to you that this US support for the military in Pakistan (which also controls so much of the power and economy in Pakistan just like the Chinese military in China) is why the ordinary Pakistanis hate America?  There is also a contradiction in the case you make for not displeasing Pakistan&#8217;s generals, when you declare in the opening that the war in Afghanistan is lost already.</p>
<p>Cold reason would suggest that what the United States needs most is for the Pakistani state to be fragmented, so that it can no longer sustain the Pakistani military-islamic nexus which gave birth and sustenance to entities like the Taliban in the first place.</p>
<p>The one thing you were spot on in your article was the criticism of Obama&#8217;s praise for Indonesia which is inexplicable.  You didn&#8217;t even mention East Timor which is a permanent blot on Indonesia.  One also has to agree about the incompetence of Obama and his lieutenants in foreign policy for pursuing a costly endless war in Afghanistan (when special forces would achieve the same effect) and paying off the Pakistani military in billions, rather than for all the short-term-benefiting reasons you stated.</p>

<p>Regarding our President&#8217;s trips abroad: Obama has bewildered, baffled and some say betrayed many of his loyal supporters at home so confusion about his trips should not be surprising.

		<div class="comment-text"><p>The US government is always going to keep information from the public. I&#8217;m not saying that transparency isn&#8217;t vital to the progress of our nation, but there&#8217;s a definite difference between intelligence and governmental decisions. This is where wikileaks crosses the line. It paints the US State Department as a group of plotters that are working against all international institutions and governments. The reality is that every nation has its intelligence agencies and its eyes on other nations. Intelligence, after all, is the very basis of diplomacy. What&#8217;s terrible about this is that American intelligence is being leaked by a foreigner, for everyone to see. Does anyone, for a minute, doubt that there are other nations out there that do not employ intelligence practices similar to those of the Americans? No. And it would be foolish to think so. Diplomacy in itself is an act of quiet negotiations, and the wikileaks are threatening the foundations of American diplomacy. Besides, who knows whether everything that Assange is putting up is true? Much of the information he has on the internet could be distorted. </p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse is the possibility that information that Wikileaks had unearthed about American intelligence could end up providing very strong aid to terrorist groups and insurgents in many unstable areas in the world.</p>

It is puzzling to most Americans why so much of the world hates us, perhaps WikiLeaks will slice through the fog of this bewilderment. I do not trust our government, nor do most of the people now a days.  As a government of the people, the people need to know what is going on by shining the revealing light of open policy on our actions abroad by elite power junkies the rest of the world believes are just like us, the common folk.  I could care less if the power elites get egg on their faces, I want to know everything.  WikiLeaks could potentially do more in the restoration of the people&#8217;s control of this nation than any other single method or reason. Remember the impact of Watergate when illegal actions were brought to light, then imagine the impact of finding out about tens of thousands of Watergate level transgressions.  I want to know it all.</p>

I want to congratulate you for at least acknowledging that The World does not like USA. It is true and the main reason is exactly what WikiLeaks have brought to your attention. This type of conduct is well known in other countries but no one to date have been able to prove it in writing since the Pentagon papers were leaked by Daniel Ellsdale in 1971. If you research internet you will see 8 Part Series Truth videos produced by standuppeople in California Watch them and pay attention. You will also find that 108,000 innocent civilian were killed in Iraq for no good reason. Julian Assange is a true hero for the mankind, a genius and must be protected. The World will change for the better because of WikiLeaks. By the way my partner is an American and knows how to keep a low profile.</p>

		<div class="comment-text"><p>If it puzzles you why the US is disliked, I recommend the book &#8220;Why Do People Hate America?&#8221; by Ziauddin Sardar and Merryl Wyn Davies.  Ten bucks on Amazon.com.  A top-50 reviewer, Robert D. Steele, gives it five stars, and writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ben Franklin &amp; James Madison Would Have Praised This Book, May 26, 2003</p>
<p>&#8220;The heart of this book is not why people hate America, but rather on how Americans have lost touch with reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;This book joins three others books I have reviewed and recommend separately, as the &#8220;quartet for revolution&#8221; in how Americans must demand access to reliable information about the real world. They are Bill McKibben on &#8220;The Age of Missing Information&#8221; (a day in the woods contrasted with a year reviewing a day&#8217;s worth of non-information on broadcast television); Anne Branscomb&#8217;s &#8220;Who Owns Information&#8221; (not the citizen); and Roger Shattuck, &#8220;Forbidden Knowledge.&#8221; These are the higher level books&#8211;there are many others, both on the disgrace of the media and the abuse of secrecy by government, as well as on such excellent topics as &#8220;Who Will Tell the People: The Betrayal of American Democracy&#8221; by William Greider, and &#8220;The Closing of the American Mind&#8221; by Allan Bloom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, and Mr. Scheuer: &#8220;near-orgasmic prose&#8221;?  Really?  Really really?</p>

		<div class="comment-text"><p>You are honestly insane. But then i guess it takes someone who believes that wikileaks is good for US policy to really advocate Pakistan over India. We wont be in Afghanistan in a few years. We will be dealing with China for the next hundred. Hence, the trip to India, along with Japan, S Korea &amp; Indonesia. Want another reason Obama went to India and not Pakistan, trade! And i wont go on about democracy, secular values, people-to-people link as you clearly dont think in those terms</p>

		<div class="comment-text"><p>Whoa &#8211; nice article, except:</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it’s at least possible that some time in the future the maestro of WikiLeaks—if he’s not in prison—will steal and publish US or Indian government documents&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;as far as any information or testimony has ever shown that i&#8217;m aware of, Julian Assange and, more generally, WikiLeaks, haven&#8217;t &#8220;stolen&#8221; or hacked or otherwise actively acquired anything (at least in terms of WikiLeaks&#8217; history)&#8230; PFC Bradley Manning is accused of having leaked documents to WikiLeaks, and so it has been with other leaks: WikiLeaks is the conduit, not the leak source. The degree to which WikiLeaks has aided (behind the scenes) the leaking process is up for speculation.</p>
<p>Unless I misread your article, I think this implication should be corrected.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
