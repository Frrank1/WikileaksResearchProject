<p>A truly free press &#8212; one unfettered by concerns of nationalism &#8212; is apparently a terrifying problem for elected governments and tyrannies alike.</p>
<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>In the past week, after publishing secret U.S. diplomatic cables, secret-spilling site WikiLeaks has been hit with denial-of-service attacks on its servers by unknown parties; its backup hosting provider, Amazon, booted WikiLeaks off its hosting service; and PayPal has <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/paypal-wikileaks/">suspended its donation-collecting account</a>, damaging WikiLeaks&#8217; ability to raise funds. MasterCard announced Monday it was <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20024776-281.html">blocking credit card payments</a> to WikiLeaks, saying the site was engaged in illegal activities, despite the fact it has never been charged with a crime.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. politicians <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/shield/">have ramped up the rhetoric</a> against the nonprofit, calling for the arrest and prosecution and even assassination of its most visible spokesman, Julian Assange. Questions about whether current laws are adequate to prosecute him have prompted lawmakers to propose amending the espionage statute to bring Assange to heel or even to declare WikiLeaks a terrorist organization.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks is not perfect, and we have highlighted many of its <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/wikileaks-domain/">shortcomings</a> on this website. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s time to make a clear statement about the value of the site and take sides:</p>
<p>WikiLeaks stands to improve our democracy, not weaken it.</p>
<p>The greatest threat we face right now from WikiLeaks is not the information it has spilled and may spill in the future, but the reactionary response to it that&#8217;s building in the United States that promises to repudiate the rule of law and our free speech traditions, if left unchecked.</p>
<p><span id="more-21432"></span>Secrecy is routinely posited as a critical component for effective governance, a premise that&#8217;s so widely accepted that even some journalists, whose job is to reveal the secret workings of governments, have declared WikiLeaks&#8217; efforts to be out of bounds.</p>
<div class="pullquote">We should embrace the site as an expression of the fundamental freedom that is at the core of our Bill of Rights.</div>
<p>Transparency, and its value, look very different inside the corridors of power than outside. On the campaign trail, Barack Obama vowed to roll back the secrecy apparatus that had been dramatically expanded under his predecessor, but his administration has largely <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/obama-speaks-transparency-subterfuge/">abandoned those promises</a> and instead doubled-down on secrecy.</p>
<p>One of the core complaints against WikiLeaks is a lack of accountability. It has set up shop in multiple countries with liberal press protections in an apparent bid to stand above the law. It owes allegiance to no one government, and its interests do not align neatly with authorities&#8217;. Compare this, for example, to what happened when the U.S. government pressured <em>The New York Times</em> in 2004 to drop its story about <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/01/70126">warrantless wiretapping</a> on grounds that it would harm national security. The paper withheld the story for a year-and-a-half.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks&#8217; role is not the same as the press&#8217;, since it does not always endeavor to vet information prior to publication. But it operates within what one might call the media ecosystem, feeding publications with original documents that are found nowhere else and insulating them against pressures from governments seeking to suppress information.</p>
<p>Instead of encouraging online service providers to blacklist sites and writing new espionage laws that would further criminalize the publication of government secrets, we should regard WikiLeaks as subject to the same first amendment rights that protect <em>The New York Times</em>. And as a society, we should embrace the site as an expression of the fundamental freedom that is at the core of our Bill of Rights, not react like Chinese corporations that are happy to censor information on behalf of their government to curry favor.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks does not automatically bring radical transparency in its wake. Sites like WikiLeaks work because sources, more often than not pricked by conscience, come forward with information in the public interest. WikiLeaks is a distributor of this information, if an extraordinarily prolific one. It helps guarantee the information won&#8217;t be hidden by editors and publishers who are afraid of lawsuits or the government.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks has beaten back the attacks against it with the help of hundreds of <a href="http://vrx.net/wikileaks/">mirror sites</a> that will keep its content available, despite the best efforts of opponents. Blocking WikiLeaks, even if it were possible, could never be effective.</p>
<p>A government&#8217;s best and only defense against damaging spills is to act justly and fairly. By seeking to quell WikiLeaks, its U.S. political opponents are only priming the pump for more embarrassing revelations down the road.</p>

                      <div class="commentText"><p>The most important point WIRED makes pertains to the impending calls for restrictions of internet-based freedom of speech &#8212; as B.Hussein.Obama and his Alinskyite minions chanted, never let a crisis go to waste. This is the kind of &#8220;crisis&#8221; that the statists will use to enforce more restrictions against those who might publish a different point of view on the net. The worst abusers, of course, are not those who legitimately want to protect classified information, but those who want to silence dissent. The way WIRED writes this story, it seems they would support a Wikileak of top secret military plans for the construction of nuclear weapons, aerosol-delivered neurotoxins, or chemical warfare agents. Contrary to WIRED&#8217;s position, that&#8217;s not what free speech is about. If someone takes stolen information &#8212; whether state secrets or industrial-commercial secrets &#8212; and publishes them on the net, they will face the consequences.  If they felt it was their civic duty, then civil disobedience means they took knowing risks and can&#8217;t complain about the punishment. And that is a good compromise in a pluralist universe. I just don&#8217;t want this to be used to shut down legitimate discussion and debate.</p>

                      <div class="commentText"><p>Wikileaks has acted irresponsibly, and perhaps as an inadvertent tool of those who want to stifle information sharing.  It is again the law of unintended consequences.  It is one thing to bring to light things the public needs to know, it is completely another to compromise the defense, diplomacy, alliances, and security of countries and people who interact with the United States. That serves no useful purpose whatsoever. Mr. Assange is making few friends, and since his financing is opaque, one must entertain the potential fact that he may actually be working for a foreign power.  His site seems to target the US in particular.  Wired&#8217;s view that Wikileaks is good for America is naive.  Free speech requires responsible action, not &#8220;poison pills&#8221;, and threats to disrupt the security of a soveriegn nation. The free flow of uncomfortable in formation is not to be discouraged, but if Wikileaks had information from the Chinese of this caliber, he wouldn&#8217;t be breathing. Nor would his source. And since Wikileaks isn&#8217;t a press organization. I repeat, Wikileaks is not a press organization, has no established location and acts more as an anarchistic group that a legitimate force, they should have none of the protections that the 1st amendment affords in the US. Wikileaks may have given those who would slam shut the free flow of information more ammunition that the worst porns sites have. If Mr. Assange makes good on his &#8220;poison pill&#8221; threat, people will die, and he will have blood on his hands.  He is playing an extraordinarily dangerous game. If someone dies as a result of these releases, you  can bet the poor kid who gave him this information to Wikileaks will face the death penalty.  Nothing good is coming from this.</p>

<p>@KB and earevalent: you both might be interested in the history of the Pentagon Papers, a very similar case, where Top Secret classified documents were stolen and given to the New York Times, which in this days was not a Pravda clone like it is today. </p>
<p>Nixon procured an injunction against publication, which the Times appealed. The case was heard by the Supreme court which &#8211; in the words of the immortal Walter Sobchak &#8211; roundly rejected prior restraint. In plain language the Supreme Court of the United States said clearly that the government had no grounds for preventing the publication of Top Secret classified information. </p>
<p>A free press was an interval part of the checks and balances our founding fathers envisioned for our republic. And in those days a &#8220;press&#8221; was literally anybody with a printing press, no &#8220;credentials&#8221;. Well nowadays everybody has a printing press. </p>
<p>The Supreme court did leave the door open for the government to prosecute under the Espionage Act, but the government chose not to. No one was ever convicted of anything directly related to the Pentagon Papers. </p>
<p>And although the papers have been entirely published by several newspapers and other publications, AND has been read into the congressional record, they are still classified. </p>

<p>The world of that vision wasn&#8217;t &#8220;Communist&#8221; except when it suited it&#8217;s purpouse.  What it was was a few major corporations ruling the world through fake wars/alliances that changed at a whim.  The great nations were more or less &#8220;Market Areas&#8221;.  They controlled all the markets, all the media so they controlled what the public knew and thought.  The proles were controlled by ignorance, propaganda and largely were ignored.  The &#8220;Middle Class&#8221; was tightly controlled, since most revolutions came from that end in the past.</p>
<p>Wikileaks (and whatever springs to fill the void if it is crushed) is perhaps the last chance of human freedom to avert the &#8220;I have seen the future, it is a boot pressing on a human face, forever.&#8221; prophecy of Orwell.  This leak exposes, not &#8220;Vital secrets that endanger the safety of&#8230;(excuse me, vomiting)&#8221; but rather the &#8220;Slimy snakes of the Globalist Bankers who rule the world, pretending to be different nations/states, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, really, the government&#8217;s assault on Wikileaks truly began when the head announced it&#8217;s next target;  &#8220;A major bank&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Proof it&#8217;s the &#8220;Globalist Bankers&#8221; running things.</p>

                      <div class="commentText"><p>&#8220;A government’s best and only defense against damaging spills is to act justly and fairly&#8221;</p>
<p>-And if if ands buts were candy and nuts then we&#8217;d all have a merry christmas.  It&#8217;s a naive proposition at best to assume that governments and diplomatic relations operate solely on a puritanical level.  The agents of our government, as chosen by the people at some level, have been under scrutiny since the very beginning of the foundations of this country.  This was the purpose of having a free press, as well as protections given to whistle blowing of corrupt or illegal practices.<br />
-<br />
-However the information WikiLeaks is posting are on shaky standings under even the most vague and loose definition of whistle blowing.  Although it has become somewhat fashionable now and in the past to claim that our government is corrupt and ignoring the will of the people, this is hardly the case when we examine conclusions drawn by independent studies and other watchdog groups.  It is clear to me  that WikiLeaks, with this massive indiscriminate &#8220;dump&#8221; of data, regardless of its relevance to acts that could be construed as corrupt, illegal, immoral, etc, is merely trying to undermine the core of the operations of the government of the United States.  Simply assuming that any document regardless of its meaning that is declared &#8220;Secret&#8221; is worthy of exposure is tantamount to assuming that denying a police office the right to an unjustified search in and of itself provides justification of suspicion.<br />
-The further argument that Wikileaks is acting as a buffer between government pressures and the sources of the information is completely asinine.  Leaking legitimately concerning information has and should be kept within the confines of an ecosystem which has a vested interest in the information and the effect it can have beyond receiving &#8220;15 minutes of fame&#8221;.  The press has more than sufficient capability to protect sources and publish whatever information they choose with no interference from the government.</p>

<p>According to your theory, anything the government doesn&#8217;t want you to know shouldn&#8217;t be made public, from the Abu Ghraib torture- reported by the New Yorker &#8211; to the CIA&#8217;s black prison&#8217;s &#8212; as reported by the Washington Post. All of these were &#8220;Secret,&#8221; but based on testimony by officials who knew they were wrong. But according to your theory, those reporters were traitors.</p>
<p>I think they were heroes.</p>
<p>Your response makes it clear you believe in nationalism over truth. I and Wired.com believe in the opposite.</p>
<p>Feel free to read whatever publication you like that will toe the government line, but Wired.com is not one of them.</p>
<p>We’ve done more than our fair share of critical reporting on Wikileaks, and they&#8217;ve even called us a tool of the government. But feel free to find your way back to whatever publication, from Politico to the Drudge Report, that fits your unflagging belief in the goodness and infallibility of the government. We&#8217;ll still be here doing what we do when your allegiance to power flags.</p>

When reporters and news outlets fail to do their jobs of investigative reporting, there will be other ways of surfacing information public needs to know. If that information is supposed to be secret, somebody is not doing their job keeping it secret. But in open, free society, if your government is doing something filthy you supposed to be able to know about it and demand change. That&#8217;s what makes us different from those dictatorships.

I will certainly make it a point to not read any of your writings in the future.  You might also talk to some upper management of Wired before you associate your words as those representing the opinions of Wired.com, cause you&#8217;re doing them no favors.  You cite a few cases where legitimate wrong doings were leaked, and truth was served.  Yet I have yet to see a single news article anywhere resulting from WikiLeak&#8217;s recent activities showing anything of any real significance to &#8220;the truth&#8221;.  Where&#8217;s the mass graves in the desert?  Where&#8217;s the political assassinations?  Where&#8217;s the abuse of civilians?  Where&#8217;s the bags of money being thrown in the trunks of *our* representatives.  Oh I&#8217;m sorry, what we really have is rough opinions and free flowing thoughts and assumptions between diplomats and their superiors summing to nothing more than an undermining of how our government operates.  Stop acting like a paranoid conspiracy theorist on a crusade to expose the government as being worse than that of some 3rd world African nation.</p>

Perhaps not a bad idea, I think the Drudge Report would welcome your narrowminded, jingoist patriotism with open arms, maybe you could even suggest something along the lines of the &#8220;House Un-American Activities Committee&#8221;, you might even become a new Roy Cohn.<br />

United States.  Uneducated postings abound, and as an American, I am embarrassed by Patriotism to the exclusion of thinking.  [By the way, The Pentagon Papers are still classified!]</p>
<p>The Espionage Act (of 1917) does NOT apply to foreigners, no matter how injurious their spying may be.  However, wikileaks wasn&#8217;t even spying!  This whole cable-gate is really about a kid who copied (illegally) secrets, and disseminated them.  Once disseminated, the cat is out of the bag.  Better luck with security in the future- but wikileaks is not the issue!</p>

IF what you say is true, then why doesn&#8217;t US media outlets pay for stolen secret info from foreign governments.  Remember Assange tried to sell the Venezuelua  communications (gov communiques as I recall)  in a bidding process back in ?08? or ?09?.</p>
<p>if once stolen , info is legal to publish, then how come credit card warez sites are illegal in most of the world?</p>
<p>/info may wnat to be free, but until you show me yours, your are a hypocrite.</p>

                      <div class="commentText"><p>I think this author is confusing transparency with democracy. They aren&#8217;t the same. This is an attack on the USA using information as a weapon. Why aren&#8217;t other regimes attacked? </p>
<p>The author implies through his support of Assange, that foreign nationals who cooperate with the USA are fair game for reprisal by our enemies? This means informants who tip off US military units about IED factories and infiltration routes are &#8220;outed&#8221; and left to be killed by our enemies.</p>
<p>I guess the death of those who cooperated with the USA is a fair trade for transparency, in the minds of this small minded purist. </p>
<p>Now Assange is planning to release the locations of secret government installations, including nuclear weapons stores world wide. There are some in this country who would enjoy seeing the USA&#8217;s allies noses rubbed in this. Let&#8217;s not forget that if he has our locations, he likely has Russia&#8217;s but will not release them because his enemy is not Russia, it is the USA. </p>
<p>Also, this quite likely has finished off Obama&#8217;s Presidency by creating even greater weakness in his foreign policy efforts. I&#8217;m no great fan of Obama, but he is our President and represents our foreign policy interests. He, and therefor all of us have been weakened on the international stage and this is not good for anyone who is an American. </p>
<p>Assange is an enemy of the USA, and should be treated as such. He should be arrested, tried, and sent to Gitmo to wait execution. </p>
<p>He is the best gift the enemies of transparency and democracy could have hoped for.</p>

                      <div class="commentText"><p>Let me get this straight. Wired considers it “A truly free press” when stolen documents are published on line.  Using that logic, if a website posts stolen social security numbers, or credit card numbers, or bank information, we should just consider it “free press”. The fact that this act is damaging to, and can compromise the security of our country, does not matter. Maybe someone should hack into Wired’s system, steal all of the private emails, confidential material, and financial information and send it to Wikileaks  to post it on the web site. While they are at it they should illegally obtain compromising information about this author. Certainly there would be nothing wrong with that after all, free press is more important than ethics and security.</p>

                      <div class="commentText"><p>I disagree strongly with this, but not for the reasons most of the other posters seem to. The author of this editorial is right, Wikileaks is a good thing. It keeps the US and the rest of the world honest. The problem is Wikileaks has been subverted by Julian Assange. Thanks to his earlier post as a figure head when Wikileaks leaked information about the Afghan and Iraq wars, he&#8217;s come to not just enjoy the spotlight, but have a massively inflated view of himself.</p>
<p>Now, though, he&#8217;s crossed the line. He&#8217;s publically stated things like the fact that he &#8220;has an insurance policy [in case] anyone comes after him, legally or illegally.&#8221; That&#8217;s what a two bit comicbook super villain says, not someone working for free press. He&#8217;s stated repeatedly that Wikileaks will &#8216;hit back against&#8217; anyone who tries to mess with it. That is, again, not freedom but petty revenge. </p>
<p>So yeah, I think that Wikileaks once served a good point. But it won&#8217;t start working the way its supposed to until we get rid of the corrupt figurehead and let it go back to anonymity. As long as one person receives the credit, and especially as long that person is an egotistical man like Assange, the sight cannot work. </p>
<p>Anyone who thinks a rape charge is &#8216;trumped up by enemies seeking to destroy him&#8217; after willingly admitting to sleeping with the minor in question, but saying that &#8216;consent means it is not rape&#8217; should be in prison, not basking in the undeserved fame of a website like this. Assange has forgotten he&#8217;s only a public face, not someone who deserves any credit.</p>

                      <div class="commentText"><p>Editor,<br />
  I appreciate your discussion on the merits of governmental openness and transparency. However, I find your support of Wikikeaks based on a disturbingly immature view of what has occurred. </p>
<p>  It is clear that freedom of speech is one of the core concepts that the authors of the bill of rights intended to fight tyranny. A democratic government that insists on ever increasing levels of secrecy as it conducts the peoples’ business indicates a lack of trust between citizens and politicians (also citizens). This is a trend that is occurring in the United States, but despite the stated intent of the President, the necessary dialogue on “governmental openness” has been delayed by an apparent lack of appreciation (by both citizen and politician) of the levels of transparency enabled by the information age. American citizens certainly have the right to see how their government (at all levels) is working; however, the effectiveness of a democratic government is distinctly threatened by the potential for micromanagement that this openness also enables. We are a representative democracy; we elect politicians to conduct the nation’s business – ultimately, we must trust them to do what we have asked or democracy will fail. The real debate over appropriate levels of transparency in our government has not yet occurred; it needs to, but is not central to the argument of the “role” of Wikileaks as cited in your commentary.</p>
<p> In this regard, every child that takes a government or civics class is taught that a citizen has rights AND responsibilities. If you are a citizen of the United States, you need to understand that the liberties that you enjoy have come at a cost. The intellectual concepts you are proud to cite were born when they were written on paper more than two-hundred years ago, but have only really become “rights” as they have matured through the never-ending efforts of government and the courts; while being protected by citizens who have often given their lives to do so. While you may intellectually understand that people have died to keep us free, you have forgotten that this sacrifice is the most humble action of a responsible citizen.</p>
<p>  So, to wrap this up. As a U.S. citizen, you must understand that any nation that desires to continue to exist (even a democracy) must maintain a level of privacy (secrecy) in order to conduct both internal and external functions of government. As a U.S. citizen, you have an opportunity to change this threshold of privacy (secrecy) each time you vote, or perhaps you can run for office and take a more direct level of responsibility for this threshold. In the case of Wikileaks, this “pseudo openness” advocated by Julius Assange is not protected by the U.S. constitution or U.S. courts. He is not a U.S. citizen and his actions constitute a direct threat to our (your) liberties and the health and welfare of our (your) nation. Furthermore, any U.S. citizen that unlawfully provides private (secret) information to Wikileaks is not exercising their civil rights, but is merely breaking the law and needs to answer for their actions in court. </p>
<p> Bottom Line: As a U.S. citizen there are countless legal mechanisms to fight the battle against the (potential) tyranny of government. We have enough issues to manage on our own, do not let your rights as a U.S. citizen be thrown away by people who are not U.S. citizens and who have nothing but disdain for your way of life.</p>

Unfortunately, I think the greatest opponent of Wikileaks right now is the traditional media.  I think the idea of people going to wikileaks instead of them, and then people having access to raw unbais information really worries them.  Media empires have been built off receiving classified information and then releasing just the pieces that fit their narrative.. then making sure no one can go back and check their source material&#8230; it also gives them power, power to negotiate with governments and even win at SCOTUS&#8230; wikileaks threatens this power.   </p>
<p>Wikileaks is good for America, probably neutral for our actual government,.. but is a huge threat to media, and I think we are really seeing this in how it is being reported.</p>

<p>I think the problem is, it is questionable how many tools really exist.  Secrecy has become a blunt object, we have few ways to find out if our elected representatives are actually doing what they claim to be doing.  FOI is a broken system, even if you know what to ask for (there is no master index), the fox guards the henhouse since the legal barrier for what constitutes &#8216;national security&#8217; is very low.  Just look at all the people ranting about how much &#8216;damage&#8217; these documents have done.. operationally, they have done very very little harm.  The 4th estate has also been failing us (which historically is actually normal, the whole idea of impartial journalism is VERY modern) since they decide what they thing we need to know and what we do not, often with their own bias or goals.</p>
<p>In other words, the current tools do not work, too much has been hidden and even if the voting public were vigilant they do not have the information necessary to actually pick representatives&#8230; and most voters, as you have demonstrated, happily take the word of the government regarding things like this.. that the documents were dangerous, that lives were at risk, that our freedoms are threatened.  You are willing to give up the ability to make reasoned choices about your representation because you have been told that being informed will result in people dieing.  It is like telling a child they should go to bed or the monster in the closet will get them.</p>

                      <div class="commentText"><p>A very good article (top marks go to a similar article on Salon). It may be naive to say that the best defence is for the US Gov to act justly. Justice and freedom are the guiding principles that our constitution and country was based on. Just because it is easier to get things done without principles under secrecy does not make it right for our government not to be held accountable for its actions.</p>
<p>What really bothers me is the poorly informed commentary by Wired readers is in response to this article.  I had always thought Wired readers were of a higher caliber.</p>

                      <div class="commentText"><p>@88337744: I find your post interesting and I agree with the statement that the US citizens enjoy both protections and have commensurate responsibilities. So I would agree that individuals involved in leaking the private material should be prosecuted. They have clearly committed a crime, which is not mitigated by any positive effects of &#8220;whistleblowing&#8221; in this case. Your assertion that it is our responsibility to maintain state secrets however is overbroad &#8211; we have a greater responsibility to expose wrongdoing. In this case, the person in question probably felt he was doing that, and this question should be settled in a court of law. Again, I personally believe he overstepped his bounds and no &#8220;wrongdoing&#8221; was exposed, but this is a question for the courts.<br />
As for Julian Assange, you are also correct to point out he is not a US Citizen, ergo he does not have the same responsibility to protect secret information, and cannot be prosecuted under US law. Are you suggesting some kind of extra-judicial measures be taken against him? On what legal grounds (either under US law or international law)?</p>

this is absolute nonsense.  your vote provides no means to affect the level of privacy for documents or yourself.  even taking the representative seat does not provide this &#8230; as the whole system is corrupted by money &#8230; the current momentum of the system for the protection of that system &#8230; and the power it provides to those who run it.  the most significant threat to the security and liberty of the u.s. and it&#8217;s citizens is in fact the representative body that&#8217;s been tasked w/ protecting it.  the current threats facing the u.s. are blowback from foreign policy of thirty years ago &#8230; and the blowback from the current folly that&#8217;s now passing for foreign policy will make this situation look tame.  these same representatives have bankrupted the country &#8230; and made outright financial fraud legal (late 2008 near collapse of the western capitalist system).  orwells 1984 is playing out almost exactly as it was originally written.  the only thing missing is the removal of any information that doesn&#8217;t fit w/ the govt&#8217;s version of the story &#8230; oh wait &#8230; that&#8217;s happening too!</p>

<p>I absolutely agree with you that that was a legitimate leak, and the truth was served.  Except that was what, a year ago?  Now WikiLeaks has dumped thousands of times more information, and there&#8217;s nothing even close to the magnitude as that event which you refer to.</p>

                      <div class="commentText"><p>@Smoke_Jaguar4 said &#8221; Has Wikileaks published any confidential or secret information that belongs to an organization other than U.S. government or business interests? If Wikileaks published, for example, Iranian nuclear secrets would the U.S. continue to denounce them?&#8221;</p>
<p>About Iranian nuclear secrets&#8230; Yes. </p>
<p>In July 2009, Wikileaks exposed a great embarrassment to Iran. Western nations developed a computer virus that targeted the computer systems of Iran&#8217;s nuclear facilities and it destroyed 25% of their capacity. The head of Iran&#8217;s Atomic Energy Department resigned as a result of the disclosure. </p>
<p>Wikileaks also dished the dirt on:<br />
Somalia &#8211; Somali government authorized assassinations<br />
Kenya &#8211; documents that outlined corruption in the family of a political leader<br />
United Kingdom &#8211; documents about the British National Party<br />
Peru &#8211; Documents about a scandal involving politicians and kick backs to a Peruvian Oil Comapny.<br />
Barclays Banks &#8211; Documents detailed serious crimes committed through off-shore subsidiaries<br />
Julius Baer &#8211; a Swiss Bank charged with funneling multiple illegal activities through their Caymen Island branch.<br />
Kaupthing Bank &#8211; Executives of this Icelandic banks were stealing money (and later called them loans), and when the economy turned the bank was insolvent due in large part to the internal fraud. The economy of Iceland nearly collapsed in the wake of this bank scandal.<br />
Oil Companies dumping toxic waste in parts of Africa &#8211; Dumping toxic waste is many parts of Africa has resulted in locals no longer able to grow food or catch fish. This contributes to civil wars and open sea piracy.<br />
Bilderberg Group &#8211; Secret docs about their founding and content of their meetings<br />
Church of Scientology &#8211; Internal documents that discuss how to &#8220;audit&#8221; the &#8220;thetan&#8221; levels of church members. </p>
<p>Other major releases include posting hundreds of thousands of pager &amp; txt messages that the NSA intercepted and blocked on 9/11 during the attacks. Something like a half a million messages.</p>
<p>Lefties loved Wikileaks when they posted information sent to them by a hacker who got into Sarah Palin&#8217;s Yahoo! email account.</p>
<p>And Righties loved Wikileaks when they posted information sent to them by a hacker who got into a global warming research facility&#8217;s email server. </p>
<p>The stuff yet to be released include secret documents from the Kremlin that the Russians are trying to block. </p>
<p>There was an (BP) oil spill in Albania that will get illuminated.</p>
<p>And a major US Bank is waiting to see what is coming for them. This release could be very interesting to American homeowners. There is some question as to the ownership of millions of mortgages. Since the taxpayers plugged hundreds of billions into banks and bought hundreds of billions of mortgaged back securities, there is serious concern that millions of people will figure out that their mortgage was paid for by the US Treasury and written off the balance sheet of their bank&#8230; so they could be paying mortgage on a debt that no longer exists. </p>
<p>As you can see, Julian Assange has pi$$ed off a lot of powerful people, governments, and corporations. </p>
<p>And I guess since charging him with kiddie porn would be too obvious, he&#8217;s going down the river for having sex in Sweden without a condom.</p>

<p>Wikileaks in arround since 2006, revealing dirt about so many other states, before politicians shamelessly called for assasinations in broad daylight. In the name of the people!</p>
