<p><strong>Edit 19/3 4.00pm: The Minister has refuted the authenticity of the list in a <a href="http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2009/014">media release</a>. Indications are that the leaked list contains the ACMA list plus sites chosen by the filter vendor. In any case, comments about individual sites on the list should therefore be treated with caution.</strong></p>
<p>Electronic Frontiers Australia today hailed the leaking of the government's secret internet blacklist as a "wake-up call for Australians concerned about secret censorship". The blacklist, which appeared on the whistle-blower site Wikileaks, is compiled by the Australian Communications and Media Authority and distributed to the vendors of approved internet filters, but is otherwise secret.</p>
<p>"The leaking of the list has confirmed some of our worst fears," said EFA Vice-Chair Colin Jacobs. "This was bound to happen, especially as mandatory filtering would require the list to be distributed to ISPs all around the country. The Government is now in the unenviable business of compiling and distributing a list which includes salacious and illegal material and publicising those very sites to the world."</p>
<p><span id="more-443"></span></p>
<p>The blacklist, which EFA tried unsuccessfully to obtain under Freedom of Information laws, was expected to contain not only some sites publishing illegal material involving minors, but also a majority of sites that were blocked for other reasons. Nevertheless, an examination of the list by EFA has turned up a few very surprising additions. YouTube videos, a MySpace profile, online poker parlours and a site containing poison information were present, as well as many apparently harmless sites such as that of a tour operator and a satirical encyclopedia.</p>
<p>"Now that we have seen the list, it is clearly not the perfect weapon against child-abuse it has been made out to be," said Jacobs. "Many of the sites clearly contain only run-of-the-mill adult material, poker tips, or nothing controversial at all. Even if some of these sites may have been defaced at the time they were added to the list, how would the operators get their sites removed if the list is secret and no appeal is possible?"</p>
<p>The leaking of the list on Wikileaks is ironic, as ACMA this week confirmed that another Wikileaks page containing a similar blacklist from Denmark is now on their own list. It is therefore presumed that the leaked ACMA blacklist will itself be blacklisted.</p>
<p>"Controlling the spread of information on the internet is not as simple as some in government would like to believe," said Jacobs. "The leaking of this blacklist is a timely lesson in this, and we hope the Government will take this to heart before imposing a filter on the entire country."</p>

What is most surprising to those of us in the business is the paucity of websites on the list...   To work correctly the list SHOULD be 10s of thousands of websites, not the paltry few shown.  1000s of &quot;SHOULD be banned&quot; websites are not on the list..  </p>

I&#039;ve found a few websites that are offering free downloads of this file as well as website that have this converted to a txt file document on their sites - eg. when you click on the web address containing the txt file, you go straight into the text file with the complete list. What the Australian Government has done is compiled a list of child pornography websites for peadophiles worldwide to download this list to their hearts content. In trying to keep children safe, the Australian Government has actually done the opposite and have now harmed children more by publishing a list of child porongraphy websites for peadophiles who may not have known about some of these websites.</p>

Apart from giving me a ready-made list for all the worst child porn sites available (I had NO knowledge of these before, nor could I search for them on google if I&#039;d wanted to - thanks Kevin Rudd, for peddling child porn), I noted with a raised eyebrow that a handful of LEGITIMATE Porn sites to which I used to be a subscriber were also included in the list. I might add, these were LEGAL porn sites, featuring consenting ADULTS, run by honest and responsible businesses. Today Labor has decided that me, and the thousands of law-abiding adults who subscribed to those sites are criminals now.  </p>
<p>This is pretty disgusting, and even more alarming for Democracy. What next, Minister exchanges with Afghainstan and China? State-sponsored illegal organ harvesting like China (&quot;for your own good&quot;).  What industry will the Government decide to censor next?  I voted Labor at the last election - after seeing this, I will never vote for them again.</p>

This is EXACTLY like the Brits blocking Wikipedia because one page had a picture of a band&#039;s album cover which someone didn&#039;t like. An album cover that was at least five years old. ACMA are clueless; the bird has flown, the information is ALREADY OUT THERE. I want my access to Wikileaks back, you total morons. Atom Egoyan</p>

The government was warned and warned the list would be leaked if it continued down the road of filtering ... now it seems they have only themselves to blame for empowering the spread of CP on the internet ....a Democracy is supposed to mirror the majority, here we have a government that blatantly disregards the wants and freedoms of the majority, i think we should have a internet blackout day in protest of the governments regressive internet policy,s ... i call for Blackout day on April the 19th 2009 as a protest ................</p>

We call them oppressive political regimes. We send troops over there to &quot;fight for freedom&quot;. What a joke ! Two years from now the internet will be as heavily censored in Australia as it is in Iran or Saudi. Where is this freedom we all profess so loudly ??? Are we really this easy to con ???</p>

I refuse to work in a communistic nation like Australia. How ironic that Hong Kong is part of China and more free than Australia.</p>
<p>I have another net business with 25 servers and 100Tb of data. All of it to be moved offshore. With it goes the jobs. </p>
<p>The first tool of tyranny is to silence dissent. </p>
<p>Australia is being prepared for the New World Order takeover. Cut news from the outside world. Silence dissidents. Dumb down the people  and turn them into serfs. Wake up sheeple. </p>
<p>I&#039;m outta here. The jobs are following. Evidence Conroy&#039;s madness is costing jobs when Australia can&#039;t afford to lose them. Furthermore, the county is a laughing stock. We need a Bill of Rights - urgently. None of this common law rights nonsense. We want recognition of nothing less than our god given rights.</p>

<p>Of the two BIG tasks this guy has on his plate (ie, the National Broadbank Network and Internet censorship),</p>
<p>I think Conroy wastes time on the Censorship task, eg, because he seems to understand it better than the NBN.</p>
<p>Again, none of the answered I&#039;ve heard him offer to journos (on broadcast interview) have seemed to be clear.</p>
<p>The emotions he expresses are those of a stressed puppy. This guy has to go or Rudd has to replace him. Improved Internet access for all Aussies is too important to be in the hands of such a dim globed fellow.</p>
<p>My 2.2 cents.</p>

There has been a push for internet censorship in the US for some time and in January this year the Supreme Court threw it out as unconstitutional. The first amendment right to free speech is inviolable in the US and you have to admire them for it.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you how ashamed and embarrassed I will be to have to admit to people that I live in a country that practices blanket censorship previously only associated with countries like China, North Korea and Saudi Arabia.</p>

	<li id="comment-829"><cite>Comment by Captain Sensible &#8212; March 20, 2009 @ <a href="#comment-829">4:49 pm</a></cite> 	<p>The whole idea of keeping the ACMA list secret defies one of the basic tenets of the rule of law. In order to be able to avoid breaking any law, the people need to know what that law is. If today the government secretly passed legislation that made the use of mobile phones illegal. Tomorrow ninety percent of the population would be criminals and would not know it. It&rsquo;s the same thing: if you do not know what is on the ACMA blacklist, how can you refrain from linking to or visiting those sites? I just (deliberately) went and had a look at the &lsquo;My life in child porn&lsquo; page on Wikileaks (naturally I cannot link to it or the EFA will be fined $11,000 a day) and in doing so  I am accessing a blacklisted page. The aforementioned page contains no child pornography, it appears to have been blacklisted simply for containing the words &lsquo;child porn&rsquo;. Where&rsquo;s the sense in that?</p>

<p>power that technology can provide.  how long before we have keystroke registers pumped through text engines linked to govt servers registering sites visited or streams of txt they dissapprove of.   how long before face recognition systems mean orwellian telescreens ?  if you remove the instruments of free thought from the citizens you control there ability to oppose govt and this is a utopian state of affairs for any pure rulership - who decides these things ?&gt; the fact that average jo doesnt see the long term implications in our future is distressing to me. i certainly dont have a tin foil hat or any kind of paranoia but i recognise the small steps in the potential of a bigger and less palatable picture</p>

	<li id="comment-833"><cite>Comment by John &#8212; March 21, 2009 @ <a href="#comment-833">1:33 am</a></cite> 	<p>Senator Conroy should be dismissed for his blatant incompetence.  Thanks to his idiocy, Australia is now becoming a &quot;laughing stock&quot;.  Countries that value civil liberties and free speech, are now viewing Australia as an authoritarian state that tramples the rights of its citizens. Under the Howard Government we had the inhumane detention of refugees.  Under the Rudd Government, it appears that we are getting more of the same with secret censorship and suppression of free speech, enforced through potential criminal charges and massive fines. Senator Conroy&#039;s actions are anti-democratic. By compiling a blacklist of websites Conroy has actually promoted the spread of porn. Conroy is a disgrace. He should be removed from the federal ministry forthwith!</p>

The blacklist, which EFA tried unsuccessfully to obtain under Freedom of Information laws, was expected to contain not only some sites publishing illegal material involving minors, but also a majority of sites that were blocked for other reasons. Nevertheless, an examination of the list by EFA has turned up a few very surprising additions.</p>
