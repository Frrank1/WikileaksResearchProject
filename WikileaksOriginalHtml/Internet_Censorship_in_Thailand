<p>The Thai Web-blocking situation is difficult to analyze with any precision for several reasons. The first is that the censors don’t seem equipped to use sophisticated techniques; e.g., they couldn’t figure out how to block a single video so instead blocked the entire YouTube domain. The second is that Web-blocking is accomplished via a multi-layered technique by several government agencies and commercial interests. The third reason the situation is difficult to analyze is that blocking is sporadically enforced, now you see it now you don't. Finally, censorship is ongoing and the list of blocked Webpages is actively changing. Fortunately for those interested in studying the situation some dated lists of blocked Websites has been leaked to Wikileaks by Freedom Against Censorship Thailand (FACT), and are hosted here.  FACT also publishes these lists of their Website and will post more as they become available.
</p><p>Despite the fact that Internet censorship has been ruled illegal in Thailand by the Council of State law-drafting body, Injunctions against sites perceived as having anti-coup sentiments have also been used directly, see <a href="/wiki/The_injunction_of_thaijustice.com" title="The injunction of thaijustice.com">The injunction of thaijustice.com</a> (Sep 16, 2007).  Midnight University, a public online institution, fought their block following the September 2006 coup d'etat and became the only legal Website in Thailand, protected by an Administrative Court restraining order against further blocking.
</p><p>Currently there are more than 50,000 Websites blocked in Thailand.  OpenNet Initiative, a censorship watchdog partnered at Harvard University, University of Toronto and Cambridge University has engaged in extensive, independent testing in Thailand in order to determine the magnitude of Web filtering.

<a name="Introduction"></a><h2> <span class="h2redfont">I</span><span class="mw-headline">ntroduction</span> </h2>
<p>Thai Web-blocking is the result of a multi-layered approach which is supported by a new (July 2007) cybercrime law, and can be referenced by several instances of large web domains blocked entirely.
</p>
<a name="Layers_of_Thai_Web-Blocking"></a><h2> <span class="h2redfont">L</span><span class="mw-headline">ayers of Thai Web-Blocking</span> </h2>
<p>There are several layers to Thai Web-blocking. The three discussed in this article are the Royal Thai Police, the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (MICT), and the Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT).
</p>
<a name="Blocking_by_the_Royal_Thai_Police"></a><h3> <span class="h3redfont">B</span><span class="mw-headline">locking by the Royal Thai Police </span> </h3>
<p>The largest layer of Thai Web-blocking is the Royal Thai Police which, when they last published their data in November 2006, were blocking 32,500 websites. 
</p>
<a name="Blocking_by_the_MICT"></a><h3> <span class="h3redfont">B</span><span class="mw-headline">locking by the MICT</span> </h3>
<div class="thumb tleft"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:502px;"><a href="/wiki/Image:Thailand-internet-redirect.jpg" class="internal" title="A screenshot of what Thai internet users would see when redirected from a prohibited website."><img alt="A screenshot of what Thai internet users would see when redirected from a prohibited website." longdesc="/wiki/Image:Thailand-internet-redirect.jpg" class="thumbimage" src="/wiki/images/thumb/500px-Thailand-internet-redirect.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify" style="float:right"><a href="/wiki/Image:Thailand-internet-redirect.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/wiki/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div>A screenshot of what Thai internet users would see when redirected from a prohibited website.</div></div></div>
<p>The MICT was established under the Thak Rak Thai government of billionaire businessman turned prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, in 2003 with a mandate to filter Websites.  Web censorship started modestly enough but by 2005, Thaksin announced grandiose plans to block "800,000" Websites.  PM Thaksin was deposed by bloodless military coup d'etat on September 19, 2006.  At this time, the 1997 'People's' Constitution was rescinded.  This Constitution guaranteed many civil liberties, human rights and freedoms included eleven articles prohibiting Internet censorship.
</p><p>On September 20, 2006, the day following the coup, coup leader General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, Order No. 5 was to block Websites and appointed MICT the rather Orwellian "Official Censor of the Military Coup". 
</p><p>The MICT did not block the Internet directly; instead it circulated its daily blocklist to Thailand’s 54 commercial ISPs to enforce; if one counts private and institutional ISPs, there are more than 100. These ISPs appear to have blocked sites sporadically on an "at will" basis. were understandably not terribly thrilled and enthusiastic about this extra onerous and useless make-work so they got around to blocking when they damned well felt like it. Thus, a website might be blocked by one ISP but, if you subscribed to another, the site would still be open. Large periods of no censorship whatsoever often accompany long weekends. 
</p><p>MICT has changed strategy at least partially, it would seem, to try to prevent the leaks which enable Freedom Against Censorship Thailand (FACT) to publishing their secret blocklists and post them internationally to Wikileaks and other free expression watchdogs. MICT now no longer circulates their blocklist to ISPs but rely for enforcement on Thailand’s four international Internet gateways: CAT, Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT), True Internet and Buddy Broadband, the latter two both private companies. However, this strategy did not improve MICT’s security: FACT continues to publish MICT’s current blocklist.
</p><p>MICT's "green screen of death" is now a historical relic. Computer users attempting to navigate to a blocked Website now commonly face browser, TCP and network error screens all of which serve to make the user think the problem is with his or her computer not with Web censorship.  Occasionally, subscribers to the various ISPs will encounter a notice stating that a Website may have illegal content and has been referred to the proper authorities for determination.
</p>
<a name="Blocking_by_CAT"></a><h3> <span class="h3redfont">B</span><span class="mw-headline">locking by CAT</span> </h3>
<p>There was also some direct blocking of unspecified sites by Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) which, until recently, was Thailand’s first and only Internet gateway.  CAT is a former Government agency which has been newly-privatised.  CAT still controls the majority of international bandwidth as an International Internet Gateway (IIG).
</p>
<a name="Recent_Instances_of_Web-Blocking"></a><h2> <span class="h2redfont">R</span><span class="mw-headline">ecent Instances of Web-Blocking</span> </h2>
<p>An interesting recent case which has received less publicity than MICT’s YouTube block is the blocking of the Weblog, Saturday Voice. “Saturday” is mostly Thai secret code for Thaksin supporters but it is also used by anti-coup activists. &lt;saturdayvoice&gt; wears both those hats.
</p><p>What is interesting is that Saturday Voice is hosted by Blogspot and, again demonstrating their lack of finesse, MICT has blocked the entire domain, tens or even hundreds of thousands of ordinary blogs on Blogspot and Blogger are now inaccessible in Thailand.  On at least one ISP, WordPress suffered the same fate.
</p><p>The premier government target is, of course, Websites which may bring the Thai monarchy into disrepute.  Thailand has strict lese-majeste laws punishable by up to 15 years in prison which sentences His Majesty, King Bhumibol Adulyadej <i>always</i> commutes.  The offending videos on YouTube fell afoul of this category; as the creators could not be found, why not just block all YouTube?  Of course, the King himself never accuses anyone of lese-majeste; only Government officials feel compelled to "defend" the King and speak in his name.  This is, of course, one of the very definition of lese-majeste: presuming to speak for the monarch.
</p><p>Hundreds of Websites blocked are reviews, quotations, translations and links to a thoroughly-researched 2006 book, The King Never Smiles, by veteran Asian reporter, Paul Handley and published by the august Yale University Press.  This is a remarkable book, particularly authored by a foreigner.  However, it does not present any news to educated Thais and foreigners living in Thailand.  What Thais find so offensive is that these private stories would be aired internationally and in English.  So the book is banned under the Printing Act 1941 and through Web censorship.
</p><p>The third category most affected by blocking are "separatist" or "terrorist" Websites representing Muslim factions calling for the independence of Thailand's three Southernmost provinces, Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat.  The most established of these groups is the Patani United Liberation Organisation (PULO).
</p>
<a name="Thailand.27s_New_Cybercrime_Law"></a><h2> <span class="h2redfont">T</span><span class="mw-headline">hailand's New Cybercrime Law</span> </h2>
<p>In mid-May 2007, Thailand’s military-appointed assembly ratified a new cybercrime law by a vote of 119-1. The Computer-Related Crimes Act 2007 was, in fact, the first law passed by the coup government. All its ‘crimes’ were already enforced by existing Thai law. Tabled on November 15, 2006 on first reading and proceeding into a 25-member committee, the law’s early drafts included the death penalty and life imprisonment but these were dropped to ‘only’ 20 years in the final version.  The Act was promulgated July 15, 2007.
</p><p>Historically, government has been biding its time to present such a law.  Its many incarnations began in 1997 and was soundly defeated time and again by several elected parliaments despite raising the spectre of child pornography and Southern Muslim "terrorist" separatists.
</p><p>There have been two arrests of unwitting cyberdissidents under the IP tracking requirements of the new Act.  'Phraya Pichai' and 'Ton Chan' had never heard of the new cybercrime law.  Their comments posted to public Webboards under their pseudonyms were considered to be lese-majeste.  Both arrests were major police raids conducted in secret and not announced to the press.  The two, a man and a woman, were held for several weeks and offered a deal: for their guilty pleas, they would receive a sentence of "only" four months (which would probably be suspended).  Following their agreement, both were released on THB 100,000 bail.  However, when they appeared in court, the prosecution declined to pursue the case.  In a quirk of Thai law, both have criminal frecords and may be re-charged up to 10 years.
</p><p>Many expect further arrests as the Thai government flexes the muscles of the new Act.  It is likely further arrests will occur over pornography and the use of circumvention software or anonymous proxies which conceal a user's IP address.  The criminalisation of concealing one's IP address actually makes this law the centrepiece of much more draconian Internet censorship than that in China, Saudi Arabia, Iran or even Vietnam.  
</p>
<a name="Provisions_concerning_computer_users"></a><h3> <span class="h3redfont">P</span><span class="mw-headline">rovisions concerning computer users</span> </h3>
<p>Although the cybercrime law never refers to censorship, its provisions have been drafted in such a way as to criminalize everyday computer users. Computer users can now be charged for simply viewing any Website hosting content deemed to be “illegal, offensive or obscene” whether or not it has been blocked by government.
</p><p>Use of circumvention software or anonymous proxies is considered to be “illegal instructions” (same legal weight as viruses, for example); concealing one’s IP address by these or other means carries penalties of two and four years.
</p>
<a name="Provisions_concerning_ISP.27s"></a><h3> <span class="h3redfont">P</span><span class="mw-headline">rovisions concerning ISP's</span> </h3>
<p>Furthermore, all such “illegal content” which transits ISP servers, however momentarily or inadvertently, with or without the ISP’s knowledge or consent, prescribes even more severe criminal penalties for the ISP’s.
</p><p>Even though all Internet censorship is specifically illegal and unConstitutional in Thailand, the cybercrime law gives a big incentive to ISPs to self-censor so they don’t end up on the wrong side of the law. We are now not able to figure out who exactly is censoring what in Thailand, a censorship free-for-all, except for Thai people. In fact, it is now a common occurrence for a Website to be available to customers of one ISP while blocked by another.
</p>
<a name="FACT.27s_legal_status"></a><h3> <span class="h3redfont">F</span><span class="mw-headline">ACT's legal status</span> </h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/User:Facthai" title="User:Facthai">FACT</a>'s divulging of secret government documents and posting them internationally as well as posting of circumvention software and anonymous proxy information is, of course, in a similar legal situation.
</p><p>FACT intends to continue to publish the means for the ordinary computer user in Thailand to free the Internet even though this action may now be considered civil disobedience under the new law. The Thai taxpayer pays five <i>billion</i> baht a year for MICT’s operations; the blocklist belongs to the people–we pay for it! Government’s original plan was to attach this new law to the new Constitution so that if Thai citizens voted for the Constitution, they were also voting for the cybercrime law; luckily, they dropped that stipulation!
</p>
<a name="MICT_secret_blocklists"></a><h2> <span class="h2redfont">M</span><span class="mw-headline">ICT secret blocklists</span> </h2>
<p>The MICT secret blocklists are leaked to the internet via groups like FACT.  Analysis of them shows that they function in part by categorizing websites and that the list is growing in length.
</p>
<a name="Categories_within_the_blocklists"></a><h3> <span class="h3redfont">C</span><span class="mw-headline">ategories within the blocklists</span> </h3>
<p>The MICT secret blocklists initially separated web pages into 9 different categories.  Categories 1-3 do not appear on the blocklists, and it can be assumed that they are deemed acceptable by the censors.  Categories 4 and 5 appear but it has not been determined what makes their content offensive.  
</p><p>The largest grouping is, predictably, Category 6, which appears to be pornography of various persuasions. Pornography is specifically illegal in Thailand. There are therefore procedures to be followed by the Royal Thai Police, including requests to Interpol to have the offending content removed in the foreign countries where the servers are located. The present approach by MICT could not even begin to stop Internet pornography in Thailand or anywhere else as there are now tens of millions of distinct websites.
</p><p>Category 7 appears to consist of anonymous proxy servers, used effectively in China and many other countries to evade web censorship. This is clearly undemocratic as public policy and violates both Section 37 of the Constitution and the Telecommunications Act.
</p><p>Category 8 appears to consist of websites containing Thai political content with many focusing on the South, in particular, the Pattani United Liberation Organization which is not a banned organization in Thailand. Even if it is a banned organization, is it legal to block PULO’s appeal to the United Nations? This also is clearly undemocratic as public policy and violates both Section 37 of the Constitution and the Telecommunications Act.
</p><p>Category 9 appears to consist of websites which content concerns the Thai monarchy. 
</p><p>Since the 13 October 2006 blocklist the categorization of websites has become more disorganized. Category 6 is now salted with anonymous proxy servers and Thai political content in addition to pornography. Category 7 has been salted with websites with Thai political content on the bloody situation in Southern Thailand. Category 8 still consists primarily of Thai political content but now also contains some anonymous proxy servers, and websites containing articles about His Majesty King Bhumibhol. Category 9 now consists of websites with content opposed to Thailand’s September 19 coup d’etat as well as sites with Thai political content and some anonymous proxy servers.
</p>
<a name="Length_of_the_blocklist"></a><h3> <span class="h3redfont">L</span><span class="mw-headline">ength of the blocklist</span> </h3>
<p>The blocklist has also expanded from 1,247 websites in January 2004 to 11,329 in May 2007. The latest available MICT Excel file shows 17,775 sites blocked in total. A list of the sizes of the blocklists is included below:
