<p><a href="/wiki/Wikileaks" title="Wikileaks">Wikileaks</a> has released the 2004 Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) manual for Camp Delta, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The transparency group's disclosure follows its widely reported release of the 2003 SOP manual only a few weeks ago. A comparison between the two leaks reveals changes to official US detainee policy in <a href="../leak/gitmo-sop-2003-2004.html" class="extiw" title="leak:gitmo-sop-2003-2004.html">exquisite detail</a>. Wikileaks has also released another related sensitive US military manual entitled "<a href="/wiki/Detainee_Operations_in_a_Joint_Environment" title="Detainee Operations in a Joint Environment">Detainee Operations in a Joint Environment</a>", which is a defense-wide instruction manual for detainee operations including rendition flights, which has yet to be analyzed &mdash; Wikileaks invites journalists and the public to persue it.
</p><p>Wikileaks journalists and leading Habeas Corpus lawyers from the Center for Constitutional Rights examined the 2004 SOP manual. Among the key details found so far are:
</p><p><b>1. Non-compliance with the Geneva Conventions remains official US Policy,</b>
</p><p>according to leading Habeas Corpus lawyers from the Center for Constitutional Rights. Systematic denial of Red Cross access to prisoners remains. The use of dogs remains. Segregation and isolation are still used routinely and systematically – including an initial period of at least 4 weeks "to enhance and exploit the disorientation and disorganization felt by a newly arrived detainee", only terminated at the behest of interrogators. Both manuals assert that detainees will be treated in accordance with the "spirit" of the Geneva conventions "to the degree consistent with military needs", but never assert that the conventions are actually being followed at Guantanamo. Put into practice, neither manual complies with the Geneva conventions.
</p><p><b>2. Extraordinary increases in petty restrictions.</b>
</p>

<p>No dictionaries or periodicals and no books about English or geography; guards are not permitted to discuss
"current" affairs, even including the then year old 2003 space shuttle disaster; and no
looking at 'distinguished visitors' – down to precise procedures for
bodily averting detainee gaze.
</p><p><b>3. Increased hostility towards chaplains and Red Cross.</b>
</p><p>Despite criticism from the Red Cross, the 2004 manual uses even more
hostile and suspicious language towards the international humanitarian
body – and is still barred from access to some detainees. Further,
probably in response to the actions of James Yee, the prison chaplain who
spoke out about conditions at Guantanamo Bay, new rules prevent the
chaplain performing many duties without official authorization or
accompaniment.
</p><p><b>4. “Medium security” Camp 4 exposed as media sideshow.</b>
</p><p>A new chapter added rules for this separate prison, with
personel required to have “excellent public relations (PR) skills”.
</p><p><b>5. “Don't do that again!” changes provide evidence for abuses.</b>
</p><p>Many rule changes have little other explanation than as response to
particular abuses, raising questions for the Pentagon. Did guards use
Capsicum Spray on detainees merely for throwing water? Did guards eat
portions of detainee meals? Were haircuts used as punishment? And more.
</p><p><b>6. Changes reveal extent of suicide and self-harm attempts among detainees.</b>
</p><p>The extent and detail of these changes reveals the extent of problems
among detainees – and also, the extent to which the military went to cover
them up.

<p><b>7. Pervasive spin via language control</b>
'hunger strike' becomes VTF - 'voluntary total fasting'. The word “suicide” is virtually removed from the document. Even
an attempted hanging requiring someone to cut down is categorized 
as “self-harm”, despite "self-harm" elsewhere being defined as
actions that could not be fatal.
</p><p><b>8. Some things change, but some things remain the same.</b>
</p><p>Much of the manual is unchanged. Military dogs are still used prevalently.
New detainees are still placed in isolation for 4 weeks. Toilet paper is
still regarded as a luxury “comfort item”. Styrofoam cups are still
confiscated if written on.

<p>Addition of "CAMP DELTA RULES":- eight broard rules for detainees, to be publically posted around the camp. The rules set out a doctrine of rewards and punishments. They ban, among other things, "organized physical fitness". The general tone is given by the concluding line: "Your decision whether or not to be truthful and comply will directly affect your quality of life while in this camp."
</p>
<a name="Chapter_1:_Introduction"></a><h2> <span class="h2redfont">C</span><span class="mw-headline">hapter 1: Introduction</span> </h2>
<p>SOP now updated every 30 days, as opposed to every 120 (1-2 e).
</p><p>In US Personnel standards of conduct (1-7), list of contraband items for personnel (i.e US personnel can't have these things inside the facility). Now includes personal mail/parcels, electronic devices such as DVD/CD players, PDAs and earrings.
</p><p>Whistles, if clipped on a guard pocket, must now be clipped to the <i>left</i> pocket. (an example of the minor changes).
</p><p>DELETED 'All soldiers will carry the US SOUTHCOM Human Rights Standing Orders” card on them at all times.'
</p>
<a name="Chapter_2:_Command_and_Control"></a><h2> <span class="h2redfont">C</span><span class="mw-headline">hapter 2: Command and Control</span> </h2>
<p>Sargent of the Guard increased from 3 to 4 on each shift.
</p>
<a name="Chapter_3:_Detainee_Reception_Operations"></a><h2> <span class="h2redfont">C</span><span class="mw-headline">hapter 3: Detainee Reception Operations</span> </h2>
<p>Some reorganisation. 
</p><p>Section 3-2 moved to Infantry SOP. 
</p><p>New sections 3-8 - 3-12. Preparations for detainees arriving/leaving. Before leaving, detainees are given items including prayer beads, prayer cap, Koran, book, bag, jeans, klenex, wet wipes, comb. In addition two PSYOP (psychological operations) messages are to be broadcast about the detainee and a feast prepared for departing detainees in camp 4.
</p><p>No major substantive changes.
</p>
<a name="Chapter_4:_Detainee_Processing"></a><h2> <span class="h2redfont">C</span><span class="mw-headline">hapter 4: Detainee Processing</span> </h2>
<p>4-18 (Post processing) remains the same "Collect and turn over handcuffs, leg irons, padlocks, and goggles to the JDOG S-3 Section for return to the Air Force."
</p><p>Some change to section 4-20 (Behavior management plan). Purpose unchanged: “to enhance and exploit the disorientation and disorganization felt by a newly arrived detainee in the interrogation process”. For phase 1 (first 2 weeks), still no ICRC or chaplain contact, no books or mail, one styorofoam cup, one bar of soap, etc. Now they get Koran, but still no prayer beads or prayer cap. After phase 2 (second 2-week period), the interrogator will give them prayer beads and prayer cap. Phase 2 still fosters dependence on interrogator, prevents contact with the ICRC (Red Cross) and keeps the detainee at the most severe isolation / punishment level (5) until the intelligence group changes classification. i.e without intervention, detainees face severe conditions, including isolation from the ICRC for one month.
</p><p>“MSU” (Maximum security Unit) now called “SHU” (Special Housing Unit).

</p><p>New section on video camera operations, guidelines for filming incidents (5-16, 5-16a), which includes the rather incredible statement "Think like an editor as you shoot! Let technique master technology; don't let technology become your master. The best equipment in the world will never replace creativity and reasoning", apparently taken from <a href="http://www.crime-scene-investigator.net/videoguidelines.html" class="external free" title="http://www.crime-scene-investigator.net/videoguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crime-scene-investigator.net/videoguidelines.html</a> "VIDEO GUIDE LINES FOR EVIDENCE SCENES".

Previously level 1 detainees could walk to/from shower/recreation without leg irons, only handcuffs and waist belt; now level 2 also included. Now level 1 detainees exercise together in pairs.
</p><p>Detainee mess operations (6-9) expanded. Added: “At no time will any guard force personnel eat any portion of a detainee meal.” Detailed contents given of MREs (meals ready to eat), so that detainees do not retain wrappers/cutlery.

</p><p>New section (7-8) on identification badges.

<p>New section 27-6 OPSEC Guidelines and Violations: “Some of our biggest OPSEC violations are things that do not increase our probability of attack from an external enemy, but instead make it more difficult for guards, interrogators, linguist, and medical personnel to complete our missions.” Do not discuss “current world events or history.. such as the situation in the Middle East, the destruction of the Space Shuttle, or information concerning terrorist groups or personnel.” Do not discuss operational information. Do not share “opinions or initiate discussions” about irrelevant topics, such as “teaching detainees songs, phrases in English, Spanish, or other languages.” Do not allow detainees to see the sign-in roster. “This has led to a detainee knowing names of several US personnel.” Do not “Conduct conversations critical of another unit... This also has happened, and will not be tolerated.” But “OPSEC does not preclude a guard from asking a detainee how he is doing, ... or answering routine questions.” Do not record “operational or detainee information anywhere but inside Camp Delta... or keep personal journals with specific Camp Delta records and information.” Do not make any reference to a detainee's identity other than his serial number. “OPSEC is not just keeping secret the big picture information like how many troops we have”. Rather many soldiers “have information that could be detrimental to our mission if the media knew of it or detainees became aware of it.”
