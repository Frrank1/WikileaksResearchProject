				<b><i> Washington. </i></b> The WikiLeaks website has announced it plans to publish nearly three million more secret US documents in its next mass release of confidential material, <b>The Daily Telegraph</b> learned. <br />
It would be seven times larger than its release last month, when it posted some 400,000 secret documents about the war in Iraq on its site.<br />
"Next release is 7x the size of the Iraq War Logs. Intense pressure over it for months. Keep us strong," WikiLeaks said on its Twitter feed, adding a link to a donations website.<br />
"The coming months will see a new world, where global history is redefined." it added in a later message.<br />
It would be WikiLeaks' third mass release of classified documents after it published 77,000 secret US files on the Afghan conflict in July.<br />
The US authorities fear that a substantial amount of the next leak could include cables prepared by ambassadors and diplomats in the Middle East that could prove more damaging than the earlier releases.<br />
The State Department has previously expressed concerns that the material could reveal the "source and methods" used by the US to gather intelligence overseas.<br />
Foreign leaders could be able to read what American diplomats have written about them in secret cables sent to Washington, such as appraisals of their leaders' personalities, competence and honesty.<br />
Earlier this year Bradley Manning, the soldier suspected of providing the material for the first two leaks, boasted about providing 260,000 stolen cables to WikiLeaks, according to a former computer hacker who chatted with him online.<br />
"Hillary Clinton and several thousand diplomats around the world are going to have a heart attack when they wake up one morning, and find an entire repository of classified foreign policy is available, in searchable format, to the public," Manning wrote at the time.<br />
However, analysts said the announcement by WikiLeaks, which gave no details of the contents of the documents and said only that the release would be in "coming months", could be designed to relieve pressure on Julian Assange, the website's Australian head. He is wanted in Sweden for questioning related to rape and sexual molestation accusations.<br />
Mr Assange has been in England since leaving Sweden, where the website is based, in August after publicity surrounding the allegations made by two women.<br />
Mark Stephens, a London lawyer working for Mr Assange, said the allegations were "false and without basis". He also said Mr Assange has repeatedly offered to be interviewed by the Swedish authorities.<br />
"All of these offers have been flatly refused by a prosecutor who is abusing her powers by insisting that he return to Sweden at his own expense to be subjected to another media circus that she will orchestrate," he said.<br />
WikiLeaks has defended it earlier releases, saying they have shed light on the two wars.<br />
The Iraq files contained allegations of torture by Iraqi forces which were routinely ignored by the Americans and suggested that there has been 15,000 more civilian deaths in Iraq than previously thought.<br />
Incident reports told how a helicopter gunship involved in the shooting of journalists also shot insurgents after they tried to surrender.<br />
The Afghan logs detailed cooperation by local informers with the US forces, raising fears that Taliban insurgents would exact revenge. A subsequent Pentagon investigation however found there had been no such reprisals.

				<b><i>London. </i></b> WikiLeaks chief Julian Assange said in an interview published Sunday he had signed deals for his autobiography worth more than one million pounds (1.2 million euros, 1.5 million dollars), <b>AFP</b> reports.<br />
Assange told Britain's Sunday Times newspaper that the money would help him defend himself against allegations of sexual assault made by two women in Sweden.<br />
"I don't want to write this book, but I have to," he said. "I have already spent 200,000 pounds for legal costs and I need to defend myself and to keep WikiLeaks afloat."<br />
The Australian said he would receive 800,000 dollars (600,000 euros) from Alfred A. Knopf, his American publisher, and a British deal with Canongate is worth 325,000 pounds (380,000 euros, 500,000 dollars).<br />
Money from other markets and serialisation is expected to raise the total to 1.1 million pounds, he said.<br />
The latest project of Assange's whistleblower website is the gradual release of tens of thousands of US diplomatic cables.<br />

				<b><i> London. </i></b> WikiLeaks chief Julian Assange said in an interview published Thursday there was a "high chance" he would be killed in a US jail if he were to be extradited from Britain on espionage charges, <b>AFP</b> reports.<br />
The Australian is on bail in Britain fighting a bid by Sweden to extradite him over sex assault claims, but Washington is believed to be considering how to indict him over the leaking of thousands of US diplomatic cables.<br />
Assange told The Guardian it would be "politically impossible" for Britain to send him across the Atlantic, adding that the government of Prime Minister David Cameron would want to show it had not been "co-opted" by Washington.<br />
"Legally the UK has the right to not extradite for political crimes. Espionage is the classic case of political crimes. It is at the discretion of the UK government as to whether to apply to that exception," he said.<br />
He said US authorities were "trying to strike a plea deal" with Bradley Manning, the US army soldier suspected of providing WikiLeaks with the cables.<br />
Assange added that if the United States succeeded in getting him extradited from Britain or Sweden, then there was a "high chance" of him being killed "Jack Ruby-style" in an American prison.<br />
Ruby, a nightclub owner, shot dead Lee Harvey Oswald at a police station in Dallas, Texas days after Oswald was arrested for the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy in 1963.<br />
Ruby's alleged links to organised crime sparked conspiracy theories about his involvement in an overall plot surrounding the assassination of Kennedy.<br />
Assange has previously said that he and other WikiLeaks staff have received death threats since the website began to release a cache of around 250,000 secret US State Department cable in November.<br />
The 39-year-old has been staying at a friend's country mansion in eastern England since his release from jail last week on strict bail conditions that include reporting to police daily and wearing an electronic tag.<br />
A court in London is due to hold a full hearing on the Swedish extradition request starting February 7.<br />

				<b><i>Bungay, United Kingdom. </i></b>Julian Assange said Friday it was "increasingly likely" the US would try to extradite him on charges related to WikiLeaks, as he spent his first day on bail on an English country estate, <b>AFP</b> reported.<br />
The 39-year-old founder of the whistle-blowing website is fighting extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he sexually assaulted two women, which he denies.<br />
But speaking outside Ellingham Hall, a friend's mansion in eastern England, where he must live while on bail, Assange said he was more concerned about potential moves from US authorities.<br />
"The big risk, the risk we have always been concerned about, is onwards extradition to the United States. And that seems to be increasingly serious and increasingly likely," the Australian told reporters.<br />
Assange said his lawyers believed a secret US grand jury investigation had been started into his role in WikiLeaks' release of thousands of leaked US diplomatic cables -- a probe he condemned as "illegal".<br />
Looking relaxed and wearing a green jacket in the snowy conditions, he said the mansion was a "big improvement" on the London jail where he was held in solitary confinement for nine days before his release on bail Thursday. <br />
Media reports suggest that US prosecutors are trying to build a case against Assange on the grounds that he encouraged a US soldier, Bradley Manning, to steal US cables from a government computer and pass them to WikiLeaks.<br />
Assange said: "I would say that there is a very aggressive investigation, that a lot of face has been lost by some people, and some people have careers to make by pursuing famous cases."<br />
He said WikiLeaks had pledged 50,000 dollars (38,000 euros) towards Manning's legal fund.<br />
But he told ABC television in the US that: "I had never heard of the name Bradley Manning before it was published in the press.<br />
"WikiLeaks technology (was) designed from the very beginning to make sure that we never know the identities or names of people submitting us material."<br />
Later, in interviews with British media, Assange said Manning "is the only one of our military sources who has been accused and that means that he is in a difficult position."<br />
Meanwhile, in Washington a report by congressional researchers said the Espionage Act and other US laws could be used to prosecute Assange, but there is no known precedent for prosecuting publishers in such a case.<br />
"Leaks of classified information to the press have only rarely been punished as crimes, and we are aware of no case in which a publisher of information obtained through unauthorized disclosure by a government employee has been prosecuted for publishing it," the report said.<br />
On the Swedish case against him, the former computer hacker claimed it was part of a "smear campaign" linked to WikiLeaks, saying prosecutors had yet to provide "a single piece of evidence" to back up its allegations.<br />
Swedish prosecutors deny their case is related to WikiLeaks.<br />
Assange's release was the result of a nine-day legal battle following his arrest in London on a Swedish warrant on December 7.<br />
Although a judge in a lower court granted him bail Tuesday, prosecuting lawyers appealed. It was only after the appeal was rejected in the High Court Thursday that Assange could be freed on bail. <br />
Judge Duncan Ouseley rejected the argument that Assange was likely to flee the country, but his supporters had to come up with a 240,000-pound (283,000-euro, 374,000-dollar) surety. <br />
Assange has also been electronically tagged, is subject to a curfew and must report daily to a police station near the mansion in picturesque Suffolk. <br />
He was driven out of the mansion to report to police Friday. <br />
The mansion is owned by Vaughan Smith, a former army officer and journalist who founded the Frontline Club in London which acts as WikiLeaks' British base. He has described Assange as "courageous". <br />
Assange has vowed the allegations against him will not stop WikiLeaks from releasing further documents. <br />
"People like to present Wikileaks as just me and my backpack -- it is not true. We're a large organisation," he told reporters Friday. <br />
The latest US cables released by WikiLeaks showed that in 2005 the International Committee of the Red Cross provided US diplomats with evidence of the systematic use of torture by Indian security forces in Kashmir.<br />

				<b><i>London. </i></b> A British judge will rule on Thursday whether WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has angered Washington by publishing secret diplomatic cables, may be freed on bail over alleged sex crimes in Sweden, <b>Reuters</b> reported.<br />
High Court Justice Duncan Ouseley must decide whether to confirm or overturn a lower court's ruling that the 39-year-old Australian could be freed on 200,000 pounds ($317,000) bail, under stringent conditions.<br />
WikiLeaks has provoked U.S. fury by publishing part of a trove of 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables, including details of overseas sites that Washington regards as vital to its security.<br />
Within hours of Senior District Judge Howard Riddle's decision on Tuesday to grant Assange bail, prosecutors gave notice they would appeal, forcing Assange to return to London's Wandsworth prison where he has been held for more than a week.<br />
"I think the district judge made the right decision. We hope the High Court agrees," Jennifer Robinson, one of Assange's lawyers, told Reuters.<br />
Prosecution lawyer Gemma Lindfield argued in court this week that Assange was a "significant flight risk" and that no conditions set by the court could prevent his flight.<br />
Assange is fighting attempts to extradite him to Sweden for questioning over allegations of sexual misconduct made by two female WikiLeaks volunteers, which he denies.<br />
"Mr. Assange is wanted for interrogation as a suspect concerning among other things rape and sexual molestation," Karin Rosander, a spokeswoman for the Swedish Prosecution Agency, told Reuters in Stockholm.<br />
"It's an ongoing investigation in Sweden and the prosecutor needs to interrogate him to make a decision on the matter."<br />
The media, a curious public and Assange supporters, including celebrities such as journalist John Pilger, film director Ken Loach and socialite Jemima Khan, are again expected to pack the courtroom for the hearing, which starts at 1130 GMT.<br />
It is uncertain whether Assange himself will be in court.<br />
Internet activists have targeted websites of organizations they believe have obstructed WikiLeaks, including Visa, MasterCard and the Swedish prosecutor's office, whose website was out of action for 12 hours on Tuesday night.<br />
"I think the reason why he (Assange) is being persecuted rather than prosecuted is because of what he did by releasing the cables," human rights activist Bianca Jagger told Sky News.<br />
If the high court grants bail, Assange's lawyers still face the problem of putting together the 200,000 pounds bail in cash.<br />
Only half had been raised by Wednesday, one of his British lawyers said.<br />
A hearing on the Swedish attempt to extradite Assange is expected in early February.<br />
Bail conditions set by Riddle stipulate that Assange must stay at a country house in eastern England owned by a supporter, report to police daily and wear an electronic tag. <br />
Assange and his lawyers have voiced fears that U.S. prosecutors may be preparing to indict him for espionage over WikiLeaks' publication of the documents. <br />
Legal experts say that, in the event that the United States did prosecute him, it would be easier to extradite him from Britain -- which has a fast-track extradition treaty with Washington -- than from Sweden. <br />
If Assange was extradited to Sweden on the sex crime allegations, Sweden could not then extradite him to the United States to face hypothetical charges over the leak of classified information without getting Britain's permission, Geoff Gilbert, a law professor at the University of Essex, told Reuters. <br />

				<b><i>London. </i></b>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange remained behind bars Wednesday despite a decision by a British court to grant him bail over sex crimes claims after Swedish prosecutors appealed the ruling, <b>AFP</b> reported.<br />
The 39-year-old Australian had given a thumbs-up to the packed courtroom in London as the judge granted him conditional bail Tuesday, one week after being arrested at the request of Swedish authorities.<br />
But two hours later, lawyers for Swedish prosecutors announced that they would appeal the ruling, meaning the case will now go to Britain's high court and a new hearing must be heard within 48 hours.<br />
Until that time Assange, who denies the allegations, must stay in his cell at Wandsworth prison in London.<br />
"This is really turning into a show trial," Assange's lawyer Mark Stephens told reporters after learning of the Swedish decision.<br />
"They clearly will not spare any expense to keep Mr Assange in jail."<br />
District judge Howard Riddle had earlier granted bail worth 240,000 pounds (378,000 dollars, 283,000 euros) but ordered that Assange wear an electronic tag, abide by a curfew and live at the country estate of a supporter.<br />
"I am satisfied that the conditions I am going to impose will make it certain as far as the risk of flight is concerned," Riddle told City of Westminster Magistrates' Court.<br />
Celebrity supporters in court included socialite and campaigner Bianca Jagger, while US filmmaker Michael Moore offered to put up bail. Assange's mother Christine had flown in from Australia for the hearing. <br />
The announcement of bail prompted cheers from about 20 supporters who had staged a protest in support of Assange outside court, but the response became muted as it emerged that he would not yet be freed.<br />
Even if Sweden had not appealed, Stephens said the court had demanded that those standing bail for Assange come up with 200,000 pounds in cash before he could be freed -- and this was unlikely to be raised immediately.<br />
Another member of the legal team, high-profile human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson, earlier told the court that the rape and molestation allegations made against his client by two Swedish women should not be taken seriously.<br />
"It was very clear this is not an extremely serious offence. It is arguably not even a rape offence," Robertson said.<br />
He added that Assange was being held in "Victorian" conditions in prison and was being detained in solitary confinement and allowed just one visit per week.<br />
Assange was arrested on December 7 after giving himself up to police acting on an extradition warrant from Sweden.<br />
His legal team has condemned the claims as politically motivated, noting their timing coincided with WikiLeaks' release of thousands of secret US diplomatic cables, which have touched off a global storm.<br />
Swedish prosecutors insist their investigation is based on law.<br />
Wearing a dark suit and a white shirt, Assange spoke in court Tuesday only to confirm his name, date of birth and address in Victoria, Australia. <br />
His next appearance at the court is on January 11, with a full extradition hearing set for February 7 to 8. <br />
Earlier, Assange blasted three global giants that have stopped money being sent to his website -- credit card companies Visa and MasterCard and the Internet payment firm PayPal -- and accused them of being US puppets. <br />
PayPal has said its decision to restrict the WikiLeaks account was not the result of any US pressure. <br />
The three firms have been attacked by computer hackers for their stance. <br />
In a statement to Australia's Channel 7, Assange also said WikiLeaks would not stop releasing the data, which has included candid reflections from US diplomats of world leaders and global events. <br />
"My convictions are unfaltering. I remain true to the ideals I have expressed," Assange said, in a statement from prison he dictated to his mother. <br />
US President Barack Obama has led worldwide condemnation of the leaks, dubbing them "deplorable", and Washington is pursuing a criminal investigation into how WikiLeaks obtained the information. <br />
The latest US diplomatic cables released Wednesday show American fears about the failure of west African governments to tackle increased drug trafficking through their countries. <br />
Much of the concern focuses on Ghana, which sits at the centre of a new cocaine transit zone, according to the cables revealed in Britain's Guardian newspaper.<br />

				<b><i>London.</i></b> The founder of whistle-blowing website Wikileaks has been granted bail in London on conditions including supply of a EUR 200,000 surety, <b>BBC</b> reports.<br />
But Julian Assange will remain in custody for at least 48 hours pending a possible appeal by prosecutors.<br />
The 39-year-old Australian is fighting extradition to Sweden, where he is accused of sexually assaulting two women - charges he denies.<br />
Other bail conditions include having to give up his passport.<br />
He must also obey a curfew and wear an electronic tag.<br />
Mr Assange was refused bail last week despite the offer of sureties from figures including film director Ken Loach.<br />
A number of protesters gathered outside City of Westminster Magistrates' Court.<br />

				<b><i>London. </i></b>A secret grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, is meeting to consider criminal charges in the WikiLeaks case, an attorney for the site's founder, Julian Assange, told the Al-Jazeera network in an interview, <b>CNN</b> reported.<br />
"We have heard from Swedish authorities there has been a secretly empaneled grand jury in Alexandria. ... They are currently investigating this," Mark Stephens told Al-Jazeera's Sir David Frost on Sunday, referring to WikiLeaks. The site, which facilitates the disclosure of secret information, has been slowly releasing a trove of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables since November 28.<br />
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said last week that he had authorized "significant" actions related to a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks' publication of the cables but has declined to elaborate.<br />
Assange is sought for questioning in connection with allegations of sexual assault in Sweden. He surrendered to British authorities last week.<br />
"I think that the Americans are much more interested in terms of the WikiLeaks aspect of this," Stephens told Al-Jazeera. He said it was his understanding that Swedish authorities have said that if Assange is extradited there, "they will defer their interest in him to the Americans. ... It does seem to me that what we have here is nothing more than a holding charge." The United States just wants Assange detained, he said, so "ultimately they can get their mitts on him."<br />

				<b><i>Brussels.</i></b> European Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response Kristalina Georgieva said that the anti-cholera efforts undertaken before of the post-electoral riots have reduced the daily rate of cholera deaths from 50 on 23th of November to 22 on 4th of December, a press release of the European Commission reports.<br />
“We are working to continue with this positive trend, but to be successful, humanitarian workers and victims of cholera need peace. Insecurity is killing more people by preventing treatment than by violence in the streets. If turmoil persists, the cholera epidemic can go out of control. It is essential to allow patients to be treated, clean water to be provided and good sanitation to be ensured. If we fail to do so, the consequences could be devastating,” Georgieva remarked.<br />
“The present riots in Haiti are having serious consequences on the humanitarian aid operations in Haiti. Many people affected by cholera no longer have access to life-saving treatment, because widespread violence prevents cholera treatment centres from operating and medical personnel from moving around freely. The violence is also preventing the delivery of clean water and other basic services, both to cholera affected communities and to the numerous tented camps which still house more than one million people affected by the 12 January earthquake,” the European Commissioner said further.<br />
Commissioner Georgieva added that EUR 12 million in humanitarian funding that was made available to respond to the epidemic from the outset is now exhausted and another aid package of €10 million is under preparation. Commissioner Georgieva stressed that unimpeded access to all those in need and respect for basic humanitarian principles is an absolute prerequisite for more funds being made available.<br />
The epidemic, which has been ravaging the country in waves for nearly two months, has already affected more than 93,000 people and killed over 2,100. These figures are likely to rise dramatically the longer the current unrest goes on. The situation is particularly worrying in areas where the cholera attack and lethality rates are currently very high. <br />

				<b><i>Port-au-Prince. </i></b> The international community stepped up pressure on Haiti, urging the country's leaders to find a quick and peaceful solution to a post-election crisis sparked by a vote recount plan opposed by opposition candidates, <b>AFP</b> reports.<br />
Ambassadors from the United States, France, Spain, Brazil, the United Nations, the Organization of American States and the European Union urged Haitian presidential candidates to prevent violence and pursue legal means to challenge the election results.<br />
The joint statement, on the eve of a meeting to discuss the formation of a special verification commission by the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) to sort out the dispute, invited the candidates "to take part in the process of establishing the commission."<br />
Separately, the Club of Madrid, a forum of 79 former world leaders, called on the international community to beef up its presence in Haiti ahead of January's runoff vote, to prevent more of violence and alleged vote rigging.<br />
Meanwhile, conservative US politician Sarah Palin, undeterred by a deteriorating security situation and riots that left five people dead, toured the quake-hit Caribbean nation with American evangelical group Samaritan's Purse.<br />
The potential 2012 presidential candidate comforted child cholera victims at a clinic on Saturday and visited a camp that shelters victims of the January quake, which killed 250,000 people and left 1.5 million homeless.<br />
"I've really enjoyed meeting this community," Palin said. "They are so full of joy. We are so fortunate in America and we are responsible for helping those less fortunate. Samaritan's Purse is still here doing the tough work."<br />
Palin's arrival coincided with the first normalcy in Haiti since President Rene Preval's handpicked protege made it through to a second round run-off in flawed elections, pipping a popular opposition candidate by less than 7,000 votes.<br />
Markets and banks opened for business for the first time since violent protests erupted on Tuesday evening when the results were announced.<br />
The streets of the capital, eerily bare on Friday as putrid tire smoke lingered in the air, were once again teeming with people Saturday, many of them stockpiling goods, fearful the period of calm may not last long.<br />
In a bid to counter the widespread allegations of fraud and stave off further protests, the CEP announced plans to add up all the tally sheets in the presence of the three main candidates.<br />
Those plans are now in disarray after losing opposition candidate Michel Martelly wrote an angry letter to the election commission, dismissing a process he said would be rigged again.<br />
"The solution of this public farce which has already caused some regrettable losses in human lives is certainly not a simple recount of the tally sheets in the possession of the CEP," he wrote.<br />
The singer-turned-politician called for "the cancellation of tally sheets from polling stations that were sacked, vandalised, the object of massive and scandalous fraud in favor of the ruling party candidate Jude Celestin."<br />
In an interview with AFP on Friday, Martelly, 49, called the recount a "trap" and accused Preval of conspiring with the election commission and Celestin to rig the polls in secret back-room meetings.<br />
Hundreds of Martelly supporters demonstrated peacefully in the Port-au-Prince suburb of Petionville on Saturday night, chanting "Martelly or death! Martelly is president!" until being dispersed by police gunfire.<br />
According to official results, Mirlande Manigat, a 70-year-old academic and former first lady, won the poll clearly ahead of 48-year-old Celestin, who squeaked through to the January 16 run-off ahead of Martelly.<br />
Manigat has also refused to support the vote review until the electoral commission announces clearer procedures. Celestin is the only candidate currently backing it.<br />
The electoral commission on Saturday appealed for calm while it awaits the findings of a seven-member committee set up to investigate the fraud-tainted polls, the first since January's earthquake.<br />
The recount was widely expected to begin on Monday and to last up to five days, but the process would have next to no credibility without the support of the Manigat and Martelly.<br />

				<b><i> London. </i></b> Leaked dispatches strengthen Finucane family's demands for inquiry into collusion between UFF gunmen and security forces.<br />
MI5 has said that it is prepared to hand over sensitive files on one of the most high-profile murders during the Northern Ireland Troubles carried out by loyalist gunmen working with members of the British security forces, the <b>Guardian</b> disclosed.<br />
The offer in the case of the Pat Finucane, the well-known civil rights and defence lawyer murdered in front of his wife and three young children in 1989, is contained in confidential US embassy cables passed to WikiLeaks.<br />
Supporters of Finucane welcomed the revelation of the offer last night as "highly significant" and believe it could pave the way for a fresh inquiry into the killing that would be acceptable to the family.<br />
Owen Paterson, the Northern Ireland secretary, has told Finucane's widow that he will decide early next year whether to hold a hearing that could shine a new light on collusion between gunmen from the Ulster Freedom Fighters and members of the security forces. A refusal to hold such a hearing, which Paterson has questioned in the past, would prevent an examination of the MI5 files.<br />
Finucane's supporters spoke out last night after leaked US embassy cables, published by WikiLeaks, showed that: • Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister between 1997 and 2008, told US diplomats that "everyone knows the UK was involved" in the murder.<br />

				<b><i> Port-au-Prince. </i></b> Sarah Palin toured Haiti Sunday amid post-election unrest, comforting quake and cholera victims and gaining humanitarian kudos as she geared up for a possible White House bid in 2012, <b>AFP</b> reports.<br />
The 46-year-old former Alaska governor and Republican vice-presidential candidate was accompanied on the weekend trip by her husband Todd and 20-year-old daughter Bristol.<br />
On the 11-month anniversary of January's devastating earthquake, there is deep political uncertainty in violence-plagued Haiti, where rioting after disputed elections killed five people this week.<br />
During their tour, the Palins distributed Christmas shoe-box gifts to children, held the feet of baby cholera victims and offered solace to homeless quake survivors.<br />
The cholera epidemic has claimed 2,200 lives since it erupted mid-October and concern is growing about its possible spread in the neighboring Dominican Republic where more than 20 people have been infected.<br />
In a tightly-managed press opportunity on Sunday, Palin, the media superstar of American conservatism, spoke only briefly to reporters and refused to take questions.<br />
"The reason why I won't be answering questions is because we don't need to be getting political here today, okay folks," Palin said.<br />
"If some of these politicians would come here again, not to get political, but if some of the politicians would come here and see the conditions, perhaps they would see a need for say, military airlifts," she later added.<br />
But, intended or not, the Haiti tour can only boost Palin's political resume, particularly in helping answer critics who say she has weak foreign policy credentials.<br />
The fact she was accompanying US evangelist Franklin Graham could also shore up support from the religious right ahead of a possible duel with Mike Huckabee, an ordained southern Baptist minister, in the Republican primary.<br />
Stepping off a helicopter wearing a T-shirt and designer sunglasses, Palin on Saturday visited a temporary housing project for victims of the earthquake, which killed 250,000 people and left 1.5 million homeless.<br />
"I've really enjoyed meeting this community," Palin said. "They are so full of joy. We are so fortunate in America and we are responsible for helping those less fortunate. Samaritan's Purse is still here doing the tough work."<br />
Graham, president of Samaritan's Purse, highlighted the terrible year Haiti has had, first with the quake, then Hurricane Tomas -- which claimed at least 20 lives -- and now cholera.<br />
"I don't know of any people in recent years who have suffered more, and in such a short period of time than the people of this small country, with an earthquake, a hurricane, and now a cholera epidemic," he said.<br />
Before leaving the press conference on Sunday and surveying the destruction for herself with a helicopter tour of the ruined capital, Palin urged the world not to forget Haiti's plight.<br />
"Young people, perhaps through Bristol's eyes, will be able to see that what really matters in life is not the material comforts that we seem to crave and strive for in the US," she said.<br />
Palin ran in a losing cause as John McCain's running mate in the 2008 presidential election, but in a recent poll of Republican voters she was the favored candidate to run against Barack Obama in 2012.<br />
Since bursting onto the national stage like a supernova when McCain picked her as his surprise running mate, she has become something of a media phenomenon.<br />
Currently promoting a new book in which she savages Obama, Palin shuns what she calls the "lamestream media" after being battered in interviews during the 2008 campaign -- she instead embraces new media like Facebook and Twitter.<br />
A reality show called "Sarah Palin's Alaska" recently launched on the TLC cable network, featuring the family fishing, kayaking, bear-watching, and relaxing in their tiny hometown of Wasilla.<br />
Palin's prominence grew as the Tea Party gained momentum this year and her reputation as a political kingmaker has solidified, with several candidates she endorsed romping to victory in the November 2 elections.<br />
But the polarizing populist is no favorite of the Republican establishment, which regards her as bad nationwide match-up against Obama in 2012 and has looked on with dismay as she has become an increasingly powerful player.<br />

				<b><i>Tehran. </i></b>Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi said Wikileaks has exposed the Islamic regime's "vulnerability" due to its government's policies which have left Tehran without allies in the Gulf, <b>AFP</b> reported.<br />
US diplomatic memos released by whistleblowing website WikiLeaks have unveiled calls by Arab leaders in the Gulf for the destruction of Tehran's nuclear programme as well as fear that a regional conflict is inevitable.<br />
"Some of these documents clearly show our vulnerable situation in the region, a situation fuelled by adventurism," Mousavi said in comments published on opposition website Qalamsabz on Saturday.<br />
Mousavi accused the government of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of "inciting fear, of an extremely weak diplomacy and excessive displays of military power" in the region.<br />
"They have ignored forming constructive ties with regional countries, and with these policies we do not have a real ally among our neighbours," Mousavi said.

				<b><i>Singapore. </i></b> Singaporean diplomats think the leaders of some close Asian allies are corrupt, incompetent or stupid, cables from Wikileaks revealed Sunday, <b>AFP</b> reported.<br />
Confidential diplomatic notes given by the whistleblower website to Australia's Fairfax media group contained unflattering assessments of key figures in Malaysia, Thailand, India and Japan.<br />
"A lack of competent leadership is a real problem for Malaysia," permanent secretary for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Bilahari Kausikan reportedly told US Deputy Secretary of Defence for East Asia David Sedney in a cable dated September 2008.<br />
As such, "the situation in neighbouring Malaysia is confused and dangerous," fuelled by a "distinct possibility of racial conflict" that could see ethnic Chinese "flee" Malaysia and "overwhelm" Singapore, Bilahari was quoted as saying.<br />
Another official, Peter Ho, reportedly described Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak as "an opportunist" who "would not hesitate" to be critical of Singapore if "it is expedient for him to do so."<br />
He said allegations linking Najib to the murder of a Mongolian woman in 2006, which the leader has strongly rejected, would continue to "haunt" his political fortunes.<br />
Bilahari was also critical of the Thai government in 2008, labelling then premier Thaksin Shinawatra as "corrupt" along with "everyone else, including the opposition."<br />
He also said the Thai crown prince was "very erratic, and easily subject to influence," and warned of continued instability in Thailand.<br />
In another 2009 memo, Singapore's ambassador at large Tommy Koh -- known for being mild-mannered and eloquent in public -- was uncharacteristically blunt in his assessment of Japan and India.<br />
"Koh described Japan as 'the big fat loser' in the context of improving ties between China and ASEAN," a leaked cable detailing a meeting between him and US officials stated.<br />
"He attributed the relative decline of Japan's stature in the region to Japan's 'stupidity, bad leadership, and lack of vision,'" it added.<br />
"He was equally merciless towards India, describing his 'stupid Indian friends' as 'half in, half out' of ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.)"

				<b><i>Madrid. </i></b>Protests have taken place across Spain calling for the release of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is facing extradition from the UK to Sweden for alleged sexual offences, <b>BBC</b> reported.<br />
Hundreds of people gathered outside the British embassy in Madrid calling for him to be freed.<br />
Wikileaks is publishing insights from hundreds of thousands of sensitive US diplomatic and military documents.<br />
The demonstrators believe Mr Assange's detention is politically motivated.<br />
The whistle-blowing website has angered and embarrassed governments around the world through its publication in recent weeks of classified US diplomatic cables.<br />
Mr Assange was detained in the UK after Sweden secured an international warrant for his arrest. <br />
Prosecutors in Sweden say they want to question him in connection with the sexual offence allegations.<br />
There have also been calls from some in the US for his arrest and prosecution on charges related directly to Wikileaks' activity.<br />
While supporters online have mounted cyber-protests against Mr Assange's detention, Saturday's protests were some of the first street demonstrations in support of Wikileaks.<br />
Wearing face masks associated with the "Anonymous" group of hackers - which launched cyber attacks after Mr Assange's arrest in the UK - the crowd in Madrid shouted for his freedom, outside the vast glass tower that houses the British embassy<br />
Many of the demonstrators were angry at some of the revelations in the cables, says the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Madrid.<br />
These include the suggestion Spain came under pressure to stop a criminal investigation into the killing of Jose Couso, a Spanish cameraman who died when American soldiers fired a tank round into his hotel in Baghdad. <br />
The Free Wikileaks website, which organised the demonstrations, said protests were also planned for other Spanish cities, including Barcelona, Valencia and Seville.<br />
It called for the restoration of Wikileaks' internet domain, which was cut off by Amazon after it began publishing the diplomatic cables two weeks ago. <br />
And it demanded that Visa and MasterCard restore credit card services because, it said, no one had proven Mr Assange's guilt.<br />
Our correspondent says the issue of freedom of speech is sensitive for Spaniards, who only emerged from four decades of authoritarian rule in the 1970s. <br />

				<b><i> Washington. </i></b> US President Barack Obama has offered his strongest condemnation yet of WikiLeaks' "deplorable" documents dump, as supporters of Julian Assange called for demonstrations to press for the release of the website's founder, <b>AFP</b> reports.<br />
In a call to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Obama "expressed his regrets for the deplorable action by WikiLeaks and the two leaders agreed that it will not influence or disrupt the close cooperation between the United States and Turkey," the White House said.<br />
The comments, and similar statements in a call to his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderon, were Obama's most forceful yet against the website, whose disclosure of a trove of secret US diplomatic cables has won it both condemnation and praise.<br />
Obama's call to Erdogan could be seen as an effort to soothe ruffled feathers in Turkey -- a key regional US ally -- where officials including the prime minister have railed against some of the information divulged by the documents.<br />
But Spanish online supporters of Assange called Saturday for worldwide demonstrations to press for his release from a London jail, where he is awaiting possible extradition to Sweden to face rape allegations.<br />
The Spanish website Free Wikileaks urged rallies at 6:00 pm (1700 GMT) in eight Spanish cities, including Madrid and Barcelona. Similar demonstrations were planned in Amsterdam, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Bogota and Lima.<br />
In a manifesto entitled "For freedom, Say No to State Terrorism," it demanded Assange's release and "restoration of the WikiLeaks domain."<br />
"Given that no one has proved that Assange is guilty of the offences he is accused of and that Wikileaks is not implicated in any of those," the website also urged that credit card giants Visa and Mastercard rescind their decisions to cut off payments from the website's supporters.<br />
Assange is due to appear in a London court for a second time Tuesday after being arrested on a warrant issued by Sweden. Prosecutors there want to question him about two women's allegations of rape and sexual molestation.<br />
WikiLeaks insists the allegations are a politically motivated attempt to smear Assange in retaliation for the leak of 250,000 confidential US documents, believed to have been passed to WikiLeaks by a US Army private.<br />
Assange, a 39-year-old Australian, has been transferred from the main section of Wandsworth prison to an isolation unit, according to Jennifer Robinson, one of his legal team.<br />
In the Netherlands, 75 people gathered in central Amsterdam to show their support for WikiLeaks, police spokesman Rob van der Veen told AFP.<br />
The Amsterdam rally was sponsored by the Dutch Pirates Party "to call for protection of freedom of the press" and "to express displeasure with the attempt to silence" sites such as WikiLeaks.<br />
In Peru, about a dozen Assange supporters gathered peacefully outside the British Embassy in Lima, where protestors stressed that the Assange's values "affect us all."<br />
"Solidarity has no boundaries. Injustice is injustice in any part of the world," protestor Jorge Meneses, 22, told AFP.<br />
Meanwhile, newly divulged US diplomatic cables revealed a row between the Vatican and Ireland over a child abuse inquiry.<br />
The Holy See hit back after cables released by WikiLeaks indicated it had refused to cooperate with an Irish probe into child sex abuse by Catholic priests in Dublin.<br />
In other disclosures, mining giant BHP Billiton was said to have lobbied the Australian government hard to bring down a proposed 19.5 billion US dollar deal between its rival Rio Tinto and China's Chinalco.<br />
Spokesmen for BHP and Rio Tinto refused to comment on the US diplomatic cable published in The Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday.<br />
Assange's attorneys meanwhile complained that their client was getting no recreation time in prison, was having difficulties getting phone calls out, and was not allowed to have a laptop in his cell. "He is on his own," Robinson said.<br />
Assange was described as in "very good" spirits but "frustrated" that he could not answer the allegations that WikiLeaks was behind cyber attacks launched on credit card firms that have refused to do business with the website.<br />
"He told me he is absolutely not involved and this is a deliberate attempt to conflate WikiLeaks, which is a publishing organisation, with hacking organisations which are not," Robinson said.<br />
And Assange's mother said she was worried for her son because "massive forces" were ranged against him.<br />

				<b><i>London. </i></b>We are entering an unprecedented age of free speech, right? For the first time in human history, the state will no longer have control over information, right? Democracy is about to come to its full fruition, with the triumph of bottom-up power over top-down domination, right? <b>The Independent</b> reads today.<br />
Wrong. The frenzied hyperbole generated by the latest WikiLeaks episode – an anarchic, but so far remarkably ineffectual, spasm of delinquency – seems peculiarly weak in its understanding of the basic concepts with which its rhetoric is larded. It is, in fact, the precise opposite of what its apologists claim it to be: with its unilateral programme of revealing confidential information, which it boasts is unstoppable and accountable to no one, it is profoundly anti-democratic. <br />

				<b><i>London.</i></b> WikiLeaks chief Julian Assange was in an isolation unit of a London jail Saturday, as new leaked US diplomatic cables revealed a row between the Vatican and Ireland over a child abuse inquiry, <b>AFP</b> reports.<br />
The 39-year-old Australian had been transferred from the main section of Wandsworth prison to an isolation unit, Jennifer Robinson, one of his legal team, said Friday.<br />
Assange's lawyer however denied reports that his legal team believed a US indictment over WikiLeaks was imminent.<br />
But she added: "Our position is that any prosecution under the espionage act would be unconstitutional and call into question First Amendment protections for all media organisations."<br />
Robinson complained that Assange was getting no recreation time in the prison and was having difficulties getting phone calls out. "He is on his own," she said.<br />
The former computer hacker was not allowed to have a laptop in his cell, but his lawyers have requested one.<br />
"We are trying to prepare a legal appeal and he has difficulties hand writing, so it would be much easier in order to assist us in the preparation if he had a laptop," Robinson said, without explaining why he had difficulty writing.<br />
Assange was in "very good" spirits but "frustrated" that he could not answer the allegations that WikiLeaks was behind cyber attacks launched on credit card firms that have refused to do business with the website.<br />
"He told me he is absolutely not involved and this is a deliberate attempt to conflate WikiLeaks, which is a publishing organisation, with hacking organisations which are not," she said.<br />
The websites of the Dutch prosecutor's office and police became the latest target of cyber attacks Friday, "probably" linked to the arrest of a 16-year-old WikiLeaks supporter, officials said.<br />

				<b><i>New York. </i></b>The UN Security Council on Friday expressed concern over allegations of fraud in the Haiti election but that groups should use "legal mechanisms" to settle the disputes, <b>AFP</b> reported.<br />
Violent protests since the announcement of provisional results have left at least five dead in Haiti.<br />
"The members of the Security Council underscore their concern about allegations of fraud and express their strong commitment to supporting free and fair elections," US ambassador Susan Rice said reading a UN Security Council statement.<br />
The council called on "all political actors to work trough the electoral process to insure that the will of the people is reflected in the outcome of the election."<br />
The 15-nation council also expressed "deep concern over incidents of violence." They called on all candidates and their supporters "to remain calm, refrain from violence or other provocations and to resolve any electoral dispute to establish legal mechanisms."<br />
The results have sparked angry declarations from rivals Jude Celestin and popular singer Michel Martelly, who both vowed to use legal means to secure a place in the race to succeed President Rene Preval.<br />
Haiti's former first lady Mirlande Maginat won the first round of the vote on November 28 and has secured a place in the January 16 run-off.<br />

				<b><i>London/Washington. </i></b>Internet activists defied on Thursday efforts to end their online assaults on companies seen as enemies of WikiLeaks, even as one Dutch teenager was arrested in the wave of cyber attacks, <b>Reuters</b> reported.<br />
Attorney General Eric Holder said U.S. authorities are looking into cyber attacks on companies like Amazon.com and others. "We are aware of the incidents," he said.<br />
The 16-year-old boy was arrested by a high-tech crime unit in The Hague after admitting to attacks on the websites of two credit card companies, MasterCard and Visa, the prosecution in the Netherlands said on its website.<br />
The suspect, whose details were not disclosed, was believed to be part of a larger group of hackers under investigation that participated in so-called denial of service attacks, the prosecution said. Data and computer equipment were confiscated during his arrest.<br />
The loosely organized campaign to avenge WikiLeaks against those who have obstructed its operations, calling itself Operation Payback, has already temporarily brought down the websites of credit-card giants Visa and MasterCard, and of the Swedish government.<br />
A succession of U.S. institutions has withdrawn services from WikiLeaks after the website published thousands of sometimes embarrassing secret U.S. diplomatic reports that have caused strains between Washington and several allies.<br />
In Moscow, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange showed the West was hypocritical in its criticism of Russia's record on democracy.<br />
When asked about leaked U.S. diplomatic cables which cast him as Russia's "alpha-dog" ruler of a corrupt bureaucracy, Putin questioned whether the U.S. Foreign Service was a "crystal clean source of information."<br />
WikiLeaks activists instructed their followers on Thursday to mount a distributed denial of service attack on a PayPal website that manages the integration of the company's payment processing technology with independent online merchant websites. PayPal is a subsidiary of eBay.<br />
A PayPal spokesman said the company had detected an attack on the site, http://api.paypal.com, but that it appeared to be operational, although various attempts to access the website by Reuters on Thursday were unsuccessful.<br />
Online retail and web-hosting powerhouse Amazon last week stopped hosting WikiLeaks' website, and on Thursday it briefly became the main target of the pro-WikiLeaks campaigners -- before they admitted it was too big for them, for the moment.<br />
"We cannot attack Amazon, currently. The previous schedule was to do so, but we don't have enough forces," read one message on Twitter.<br />
The activists said they would instead attack PayPal, which has suspended the WikiLeaks account that the organization had used to collect donations. MasterCard and Visa had also become targets after stopping processing donations.<br />
At 1:10 p.m. EST (1810 GMT), the websites of PayPal, Amazon -- a key Christmas shopping destination -- MasterCard and Visa all appeared to be functioning normally.<br />

				<b><i> Moscow. </i></b> Vladimir Putin leads a growing band of international leaders voicing support for WikiLeaks' boss Julian Assange, describing his detention in Britain as "undemocratic", <b>AFP</b> reports.<br />
The Russian prime minister's broadside came as hackers escalated their cyber war on opponents of the whistleblower website, setting their sights on Amazon.com.<br />
"Why was Mr Assange hidden in jail? Is that democracy? As we say in the village: the pot is calling the kettle black," Putin said on Thursday in response to a question on Russia's undemocratic image in US embassy cables leaked by the website.<br />
His comments echoed Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who expressed "solidarity" with Assange, blasting the Australian activist's arrest as a blow against "freedom of expression".<br />
Assange has "exposed a diplomacy that had appeared unreachable," said Lula, who criticised the failure of other governments to challenge Assange's detention.<br />
"They have arrested him and I don't hear so much as a single protest for freedom of expression," he said.<br />
Anonymous, the loose-knit group of hackers behind the cyber attacks, announced an assault on the Amazon website for 1600 GMT (0300 AEDT Friday) as part of Operation Payback.<br />
The move appeared to be part of a developing tit-for-tat cyber conflict targeting companies in reprisal for withdrawing from doing business with WikiLeaks.<br />
Amazon last week booted WikiLeaks off its servers, saying the company had violated its terms of service.<br />
Visa, MasterCard and PayPal earlier suffered disruption to their websites in retaliation for their decision to stop accepting payments for the whistleblower, which rocked global diplomacy last week by dumping 250,000 secret US embassy cables onto its website.<br />
Navi Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, hit out at pressure being exerted on "private companies, banks and credit card companies" to cut commercial ties to WikiLeaks.<br />
"They could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information, thus potentially violating WikiLeaks' right to freedom of expression," she told a press conference in Geneva.<br />
Anonymous told AFP in an online chat they would attack anyone they perceive as having an "anti-WikiLeaks agenda".<br />
The Swedish government's website was forced offline as was the Swedish prosecutor's office.<br />
Organisers told AFP they had started with only about 50 users taking part in the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that bombard websites to take them offline, but now had about 4000.<br />
"We recruit through the internet, that means, everywhere: imageboards, forums, Facebook, Twitter... you name it, we're using it," they said.<br />
Twitter and Facebook later removed accounts for the Anonymous group's Operation Payback campaign on the grounds that it was targeting individuals.<br />
WikiLeaks distanced itself from the group in a statement, saying it had no affiliation with Anonymous.<br />
WikiLeaks' Kristinn Hrafnsson said the attacks "are of a similar nature to those received, and endured" by the website over the past week.<br />
"We neither condemn nor applaud these attacks. We believe they are a reflection of public opinion on the actions of the targets."<br />
Members of Anonymous also took aim on Wednesday at the websites of US conservative standard bearer Sarah Palin and US senator Joe Lieberman, who called for US companies to withdraw technical support for WikiLeaks.<br />
Assange's supporters have vowed the arrest will not halt the flow of secrets.<br />
The latest revelations have caused more embarrassment for Washington. The most explosive was an assessment by Johnnie Carson, the US assistant secretary of state for African affairs, who illustrated the tensions caused by China's increasing involvement in resource-rich Africa.<br />
"China is a very aggressive and pernicious economic competitor with no morals. China is not in Africa for altruistic reasons," Carson said in a February meeting with oil executives in Nigeria.<br />
Other cables showed Washington put intense pressure on Berlin to not enforce arrest warrants against CIA agents involved in the 2003 abduction of a German citizen mistakenly believed to be a terrorist.<br />
Putin, despite his defence of Assange on Thursday, has been portrayed in an embarrassing light by some of the leaked cables. In one, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called him a "behind the scenes puppeteer" dissatisfied with his role.<br />
Others detailed allegations of high-level Russian corruption and referred to Putin as an "alpha dog".

				<b><i>New York.</b></i> Irrespective of the arrest of its founder Julian Assange WikiLeaks continues releasing scandalous revelations, Russian radio station the <b>Echo of Moscow</b> reports.<br />
Today’s releases are related with the fate of the Guantanamo inmates. The documents make it clear that the U.S. diplomats pressurized other countries to host Guantanamo inmates. President Obama agreed to meet with the President of Slovenia only if the Balkan country accepts at least one inmate. An island country in the Caribbean was offered millions of dollars to host inmates.<br />
The closure of the Guantanamo prison was one of President Barack Obama’s election pledges.

				<b><i>London. </i></b> Computer hackers disrupted MasterCard’s online payment processing system for several hours on one of the busiest shopping days of the year as part of revenge attacks on companies that blocked services to WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowing website, <b>The Financial Times</b> reported.<br />
Automated barrages by WikiLeaks’ defenders also temporarily shut down web pages controlled by other companies that have cut connections with WikiLeaks, including credit card network Visa, whose public home page was down for less than an hour. In a statement, Visa said its regular payment processing was unaffected.<br />
As government criticism of WikiLeaks’ mass release of US confidential diplomatic cables has intensified, so too has online support for the site, particularly among internet freedom enthusiasts. <br />
MasterCard initially blamed problems with its website on heavy traffic but later said some SecureCode services had been disrupted. It reassured customers that core processing capabilities have not been compromised and cardholder account data has not been placed at risk”.<br />

				<b><i>Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. </i></b>Anger swept Port-au-Prince on Wednesday as protests erupted throughout the Haitian capital the day after election results were announced, <b>CNN</b> reported.<br />
Mobs charging election fraud burned the headquarters of the government-backed candidate and blocked roads using earthquake rubble and flaming tires.<br />
At the smoldering headquarters of candidate Jude Celestin, one man shouted that life was better under the Duvaliers, referring to years of Haiti's father-son dictatorship.<br />
At least one person died in the post-election violence, authorities said.<br />
"People are very angry," said Franz Large, a Haitian doctor who lives near the burned headquarters. "People expected there would be a fair election."<br />
He accused the government of adding the names of those who perished in the earthquake to voter lists, to push the vote in their favor.<br />
He also said many people feared they would lose out on cash-for-work programs if they did not vote for the government.<br />
"We need someone who has the trust of the people," Lange said. "It's a very sad day for people who believe in democracy."<br />
All flights in and out of Port-au-Prince, including American Airlines flights, were canceled, said Henry Marc-Charles of Haiti's national airport authority.<br />

				<b><i>Port-au-Prince. </i></b>Thousands of protesters rampaged in Haitian towns Wednesday, torching buildings in armed clashes that left four dead, after election results triggered bitter accusations of vote-rigging, witnesses said, <b>AFP</b> reported.<br />
Supporters of popular singer Michel Martelly took to the streets after Tuesday night's results showed he had been narrowly -- and unexpectedly -- knocked out of the race for the presidency of the impoverished Caribbean nation.<br />
Instead, President Rene Preval's handpicked protege Jude Celestin defied predictions to snap up second place and a coveted slot in January's run-off in which he will battle a former first lady for the nation's top job.<br />
The singer-turned-politician, known popularly here by the nickname "Sweet Micky," said in a radio address that the international community and election observers recognized the results were "incorrect."<br />
"I understand your anger," he told supporters in the Creole address, adding that "protesting without violence is the people's right."<br />
Preval meanwhile called for calm in a country still struggling to rebuild after January's devastating earthquake, and which has a bloody history of political upheaval and dictatorships.<br />
"Demonstrate, that is your right. But don't attack public buildings, businesses or private property," Preval said on Haiti's national radio, after the headquarters of his ruling INITE (UNITY) party were set ablaze Wednesday.<br />
"You are giving Haiti a bad image. Conflicts are not resolved by setting things on fire and breaking things. Pull yourselves together, Haitians."<br />
Demonstrations, which had rumbled through the night, turned violent in several of major cities as well as the capital Port-au-Prince.<br />
Three young protesters were shot dead in clashes in the southern town of Cayes, some 200 kilometers (120 miles) south of the capital, former senator Gabriel Fortune told AFP.<br />
"One of the youths was shot in front of the election offices by Senegalese UN troops and two others were killed at the entrance to the town, where a police station was ransacked and the police had their guns stolen," he added.<br />
"Ninety percent of the public buildings in the town have been set on fire, and a bank and private homes have been attacked by young people," he added.<br />
A school and a radio station belonging to a candidate close to the ruling party were also targeted, he said.<br />
A fourth person was killed in armed clashes in the second city of Cap Haitien, local media sources said.<br />
The outbreak of violence caused officials to close the country's airports as several major airlines cancelled their flights to and from Haiti.<br />
Martelly has until December 20 to formally lodge a complaint with the electoral commission and the US embassy in Port-au-Prince has voiced concern at the "inconsistent" results.<br />
EU chief diplomat Catherine Ashton has also expressed concern at "significant differences between the projected outcome of the elections... and the preliminary results released."<br />
The singer was pushed into third place by fewer than 7,000 votes by Celestin, who will now run for the presidency on January 16 against former first lady Mirlande Manigat, officials said. <br />
The results credited Manigat with 31 percent of the vote, Celestin with 22 percent and Martelly with 21.84 percent. <br />
"The people came out to vote for Martelly because Manigat and Celestin are not going to sort anything out. Martelly was ahead and they have stolen the elections," one masked youth told AFP. <br />
"We will destroy the country until Martelly is made president," he warned. <br />
Political turmoil only compounds Haiti's misery. <br />
Much of the capital still lies in ruins since the January 12 earthquake that killed 250,000 people and left 1.3 million people homeless and now living in precarious tent cities. <br />
Ten months after one of the worst natural disaster of modern times, Haiti was also hit by the first cholera outbreak here in more than a century. The disease, which erupted in a central river valley, has now spread to the teeming capital and killed more than 2,120 people. <br />
Whoever wins the run-off faces the daunting task of rebuilding a traumatized nation of 10 million that was the poorest in the Americas even before the earthquake. <br />
The US embassy said Celestin's success was "inconsistent with the published results of the National Election Observation Council (CNO)... election-day observations by official US observers... and vote counts observed around the country by numerous domestic and international observers." <br />
The CNO, which is funded by the European Union and had more than 5,500 observers at 1,600 voting centers nationwide, had estimated on Monday that Celestin was trailing a clear third behind Martelly.<br />

				<b><i> Port-au-Prince. </i></b> Demonstrations broke out in several Haitian cities and gunshots echoed through the capital as the initial results of a disputed election were announced on Tuesday, <b>AFP</b> reports.<br />
Demonstrators erected barricades of tires in several neighborhoods in the capital Port-au-Prince, according to AFP reporters, who also heard gunshots. Local radio reported similar protests in other cities.<br />
The initial results had former first lady and opposition front-runner Mirlande Manigat leading with 31 percent of the vote, followed by the ruling party candidate Jude Celestin with 22 percent.<br />
Both will advance to the second round, but the presidential hopes of Michel Martelly -- a musician known as "Sweet Micky" -- were dashed, even though he came in closely behind Celestin.<br />
International observers said the vote was credible despite isolated incidents of fraud, violence and other mishaps, while several candidates accused the ruling party of rigging the poll.<br />
Haiti's next president faces the daunting challenge of battling a growing cholera epidemic while rebuilding the impoverished country following a January earthquake that killed 250,000 people.<br />

				<b><i> London. </i></b> Britain faced threats from Libya of dire consequences if the ailing Lockerbie bomber died in a Scottish prison, confidential US cables released by WikiLeaks on Wednesday showed, as quoted by <b>AFP</b>.<br />
Threats included the cessation of all British commercial activity in Libya and demonstrations against British facilities, as well as suggestions Britons in the country could be put at risk, according to the cables.<br />
And despite London's attempts to publicly distance itself from the decision to release Abdelbaset Ali Mohmet al-Megrahi - which was made by the devolved Scottish government - the cables show enormous British relief at the move.<br />
Libyan officials warned their British counterparts that "consequences for the UK-Libya bilateral relationship would be dire were al-Megrahi to die in Scottish prison," read one dispatch from the US ambassador to Tripoli in January 2009.<br />
And if Washington publicly opposed the release, "the US Embassy and private Americans in Libya could face similar consequences," read the cable from the ambassador, Gene A Cretz.<br />
Megrahi was the only person ever convicted over the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people, most of them US nationals.<br />
He was released in August, 2009, on compassionate grounds after doctors diagnosed him with prostate cancer and gave him just three months to live, sparking outrage in the United States.<br />
However, more than a year later he remains alive in Tripoli, renewing anger in the US.<br />
One cable showed Britain's then justice minister, Jack Straw, told US diplomats that although Megrahi might have had up to five years to live, the Scottish government appeared inclined to release him.<br />
"Megrahi could have as long as five years to live," said the correspondence, cited in Britain's Guardian newspaper.<br />
It went on: "The average life expectancy of someone of his age with his condition is 18 months to two years. Doctors are not sure where he is on the time scale."<br />
The British government "believes that the Scottish may be inclined to grant the request, when it comes, based on conversations between [Scottish leader] Alex Salmond and UK justice secretary Jack Straw," said the cable.<br />
The dispatches - from a trove of some 250,000 US cables given to whistleblower website WikiLeaks and now slowly being released - also showed the British ambassador in Tripoli "expressed relief" about Megrahi's imminent release.<br />
"They could have cut us off at the knees, just like the Swiss," the ambassador Vincent Fean is cited as saying, in reference to a dispute between Libya and Switzerland prompted by the arrest of Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi's son.<br />
Alex Salmond claimed Scotland was offered a "parade of treats" by Libya, which were all turned down, according to the cables.<br />
The correspondence also showed that Scotland was unprepared for the fierce reaction from the United States, with Salmond declaring himself "shocked".<br />
"The Scottish government severely underestimated the both [US government] and UK public reaction to its decision to grant compassionate release," said one cable from Louis Susman, US ambassador to Britain, several days after Megrahi was freed.

				<b><i>London. </i></b>The founder of the whistle-blowing website Wikileaks, Julian Assange, has been arrested by the Metropolitan Police, <B> BBC</B> reported.<br />
The 39-year-old Australian denies allegations he sexually assaulted two women in Sweden.<br />
Mr Assange is due to appear at City of Westminster Magistrates' Court later.<br />
A Wikileaks spokesman said Mr Assange's arrest was an attack on media freedom but it would not stop the release of more secret files.<br />
Scotland Yard said Mr Assange was arrested on a European arrest warrant by appointment at a London police station at 0930 GMT. <br />
Mr Assange is accused by the Swedish authorities of one count of rape, one of unlawful coercion and two counts of sexual molestation, alleged to have been committed in August 2010.<br />
If the district judge rules there is a prima facie case to be answered by Mr Assange, and the arrest warrant is legally correct, he could be extradited to Sweden.<br />
But the process could take months.<br />
Police contacted his lawyer, Mark Stephens, on Monday night after receiving an European arrest warrant from the Swedish authorities.<br />
An earlier warrant, issued last month, had not been filled in correctly.<br />
Mr Stephens said his client was keen to learn more about the allegations and anxious to clear his name.<br />

				<b><i>London. </i></b> Mr Assange is expected to voluntarily attend a police station within the next 24 hours, and will then appear in a magistrates’ court. He is wanted over allegations of sexual assault in Sweden, <b>The Daily Telegraph</b> reported. <br />
He is currently in hiding in the south-east of England but police are understood to have the necessary paperwork to arrest him. <br />
Mr Assange suffered another setback on Monday when Swiss authorities closed one of his bank accounts, one of the sources of funding for the WikiLeaks site. <br />
The 39-year-old Australian has been under intense pressure since the release of thousands of secret documents in recent weeks. <br />
A European Arrest Warrant was issued by the Swedish last month but could not be acted upon because it did not contain sufficient information for the <br />
British authorities. A spokesman for Marianne Ny, the Swedish prosecutor, said the extra details were sent last week and were being processed. <br />

				<b><i>London. </i></b>The lawyer for Julian Assange said Monday that arrangements were being made to meet with police who had received a request from Sweden for the WikiLeaks founder's extradition, <b>AFP</b> reported.<br />
"Late this afternoon after close of business I got a call from the police, who said that they had received an extradition request from Sweden," Mark Stephens told BBC television.<br />
"Their request is to interview Julian Assange - he's not been charged with anything - and we are in the process of making arrangements to meet with the police by consent in order to facilitate the taking of that question and answer."<br />

				<b><i>Sydney, Australia. </i></b>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange would be allowed to return to his Australian homeland, and has the same protections any other Australian citizen would, the nation's attorney general said Monday, <b>CNN</b> reported.<br />
Attorney General Robert McClelland's comments came in response to Assange's assertion last week that McClelland and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard "have made it clear that not only is my return impossible, but that they are actively working to assist the United States government in its attacks on myself and our people.<br />
"This brings into question what does it mean to be an Australian citizen -- does that mean anything at all?" Assange said Friday in written answers to readers' questions posted on the website of the British newspaper The Guardian.<br />
"Mr. Assange, like every Australian citizen, has rights, and nothing is stopping him from coming home to Australia," McClelland said, according to his spokesman. Assange "is entitled to the same rights as any other Australian citizen. This includes the right to return to Australia and also to receive consular assistance while he is overseas if that is requested."<br />
However, McClelland also said WikiLeaks' publishing of leaked documents is "irresponsible," according to the spokesman.<br />

				<b><i>Sofia. </i></b>WikiLeaks published details of sites around the globe which the United States considers vital to its interests, prompting criticism that the website is helping militants identify targets for attack, <B> Reuters</B> announced. <br />
The details are part of 250,000 diplomatic cables obtained by the campaigning website which are being made public.<br />
The list begins with a cobalt mine in Kinshasa, Congo and refers to various locations in Europe where drug companies produce insulin, treatment for snake bites and foot and mouth vaccines.<br />
In the Middle East, it notes that Qatar will be the largest source of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) by 2012 and also refers to the Abqaiq facility in Saudi Arabia, the largest crude oil process and stabilization plant in the world.<br />
Al Qaeda mounted an unsuccessful attack on Abqaiq in 2006 and there were warnings that the WikiLeaks cable setting out so many sensitive targets could help militants.<br />
British Foreign Secretary William Hague called the publication of the list "particularly reprehensible."<br />
"There is great concern of course about disclosing a list of targets that could be of use to terrorists or saboteurs," he told BBC radio.<br />
"I think it is absolutely reprehensible the publication is carried out without regard to wider concerns of security, the security of millions of people," he said.<br />
John J. LeBeau, a former CIA officer who teaches security studies at the George C. Marshall Center in Germany, said the list "might put ideas into jihadist heads as to what to profitably target."<br />
"The real story here though, I think, is that putting this type of material online makes clear that WikiLeaks does not care about the consequences of its actions," he told Reuters.<br />
"If the leaks complicate the security posture of the U.S., or the West in general, WikiLeaks is indifferent."<br />
Professor Richard Aldrich of Warwick University in central England said it had the potential to help militants find targets in energy security.<br />
"We're pointing out to them how they should change our behavior to hurt us more," he told Reuters.<br />
"This document has been given very wide currency. It's improbable to think that the terrorists are not taking notice."<br />

The warrant to interview the journalist - thought currently to be in the UK - concerns alleged sexual crimes during a visit to Sweden in August.

				<b><i>Ankara. </i></b>Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday accused U.S. diplomats of spreading "gossip" and "slander" after leaked State Department cables alleged corruption in his government and portrayed him as an Islamist, <b>Reuters</b> reported.<br />
The website WikiLeaks this week began posting hundreds of thousands of confidential diplomatic messages, including some that show a complex, difficult relationship between the United States and Turkey, the only Muslim member of NATO.<br />
"The unserious cables of American diplomats, formed from gossip, magazines, allegations and slander are spreading worldwide via the Internet," Erdogan said in comments broadcast live by the NTV news channel.<br />
He suggested the release of the trove of cables may be "propaganda" aimed at damaging relations between the United States and its allies.<br />
A 2004 dated cable by then-U.S. ambassador Eric Edelman said: "We have heard from two contacts that Erdogan has eight accounts in Swiss banks; his explanations that his wealth comes from the wedding presents guests gave his son and that a Turkish businessman is paying the educational expenses of all four Erdogan children in the U.S. purely altruistically are lame."<br />
Erdogan has denied he has any money in Swiss bank accounts and threatened to file a lawsuit over the charges.<br />
The diplomatic messages at times show concerns that European Union candidate Turkey is shifting its allegiances from the West and Israel toward Iran and other Muslim countries since Erdogan took office in 2002.<br />
Edelman's cables also portray Erdogan as an authoritarian, distrustful leader of his ruling AK Party and say that he believes God appointed him to lead Turkey.<br />
The AK Party traces its roots to a banned Islamist movement, but denies its a religious grouping. It is gearing up for a general election planned for June, in which Erdogan is seeking a third term.

				<b><i> Tehran. </i></b> Iran and the EU will hold talks in Geneva on Monday, as Tehran sought to renew contact with world powers after a 14 month break and calm its neighbours even though it held firm on its nuclear program, <b>AFP</b> reports.<br />
Iran's chief negotiator Saeed Jalili will meet the European Union's top diplomat, Catherine Ashton, over two days in an undisclosed location in the western Swiss city, the Swiss foreign ministry confirmed.<br />
The EU will represent the "E3+3", UN Security Council permanent members Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, plus Germany, it added, the same group of nations that last held direct talks on Iran's controversial nuclear program in October 2009.<br />
Advertisement: Story continues below<br />
An EU source said: "This is an important meeting. We've waited a long time for it."<br />
"It is not important because it will produce instant results but important because we hope it will produce a re-engagement with Iran which we hope will over time produce results," added the source.<br />
On Saturday, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said western powers should "stop being hostile".<br />
"We have said many times that we will not negotiate the inalienable rights of the Iranian nation with anyone, but if they want to talk about co-operation, then we are ready," he was quoted as saying on state television's website.<br />
Iran insists that it is entitled to enrich uranium for energy and has vowed to continue the work, despite repeated ultimatums from the UN Security Council to halt enrichment because of fears Tehran secretly wants nuclear weapons.<br />
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had seized on the unwanted publication of confidential US diplomatic cables by Wikileaks over the past week to signal that those concerns were shared by Tehran's Arab neighbours.<br />
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki sought to counter those fears on the sidelines of an international security conference in Bahrain on Saturday.<br />
He insisted that Iran had "never used" force against its neighbours "and never will because our neighbours are Muslims".<br />
Mottaki cautioned against submitting to "pressure by outsiders to divide us", saying "the presence of foreign powers will not help establish security in the region".<br />
Iran's envoy nonetheless described as a "step forward" separate remarks by Clinton suggesting that Iran is entitled to a peaceful nuclear energy program.<br />
"But these words should be turned into action," he added.<br />
In Bahrain on Friday, Clinton urged Iran to come to Geneva "in good faith and prepared to engage constructively" on its nuclear program.<br />
Tehran has defiantly insisted that stepped up international sanctions have had no impact on its economy, while other tensions have grown.<br />
Iran has blamed the US and Israel for being behind bomb attacks that killed a prominent nuclear scientist and wounded another, and accused the UN nuclear watchdog of including "spies" among the inspectors it sends to Iran to monitor the nation's atomic program.<br />
The UN Security Council has called on Iran in six resolutions -- four of which impose sanctions -- to halt its controversial atomic work.<br />
Tehran insists its nuclear program has peaceful ends and wants the talks to cover political issues.<br />
Observers believe that there is little hope for a deal emerging in Geneva.<br />
Mohammed-Reza Djalili, of Geneva's Graduate Institute, said that the Iranians "want to show goodwill in discussing but I don't think they want to really negotiate after the declarations that they have made".<br />
Mark Fitzpatrick, senior fellow for non-proliferation at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said "the most fruitful thing that might come of it is... the beginning of a continuing discussion".<br />
Fitzpatrick suggested Iran wanted to be seen to be reasonable.<br />
"If they refuse to continue, they would be pictured as the bad guys, the partner that is inflexible."

				<b><i> London. </i></b> The hacking of Google which forced the search engine to pull out of China was masterminded by a senior member of the Communist regime, according to leaked US diplomatic cables, the <b>Sundy Telegraph</b> disclosed. <br />
Classified information sent by US diplomats to the State Department in Washington and published on WikiLeaks, claims that the Chinese politician became hostile to Google after he searched his own name and found articles criticising him.<br />
This apparently prompted an assault on the search engine, forcing it to "walk away from a potential market of 400 million internet users" in January this year, amid a highly publicised row about internet censorship.<br />
The allegation that the attack on Google was orchestrated by Communist party leaders has not been revealed until now. <br />
The politician is accused of acting with a second member of the politburo in an attempt to force Google to drop a link from its Chinese-language search engine to its uncensored google.com version.<br />
One cable from the US embassy in Beijing, marked as secret, records that attempts to break into the accounts of dissidents who used Google's Gmail system had been co-ordinated "with the oversight of" the two politburo members.<br />
The cyber assault was described to the Americans by a high-level Chinese source as "100% political in nature" and having "nothing to do with removing Google... as a competitor to Chinese search engines".<br />
Last December Google said that it was hit by a "highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure". Part of it was aimed at the Gmail accounts of "Chinese human rights activists".<br />
Shortly after the attack, Google withdrew from mainland China, and relocated to Hong Kong, where it was able to run an uncensored version of its website in English and Chinese.<br />
Both Google and the US suspected leading Chinese politicians were behind the hacking, but neither said so at the time.<br />
The cables show that diplomats at the time discussed whether China's most powerful man, Hu Jintao, the president, or his prime minister, Wen Jiabao, were "aware of these actions". The secret note sent back to Washington concedes that "it is unclear" whether advance knowledge of the strike went right to the top.<br />
Google began operating in China in 2006 and in a bid to gain market share from its local rival Baidu launched Google.cn, in which results relating to contentious issues such as Tibet, Taiwan and the Tiananmen Square massacre were filtered out.<br />
Google, whose motto is Don't Be Evil, retained a link to the unfiltered Google.com on its Google.cn website, which prompted months of tension with the Chinese government.<br />
A cable from Beijing notes that Google had already begun to raise concerns with the most senior American diplomat in the country at the time.<br />
Dan Piccuta, the US charg&#233; d'affaires, was told how the prominent politician had "recently discovered that Google's worldwide site is uncensored" after he "allegedly entered his own name and found results critical of him".<br />
According to the cable, the Chinese government shortly afterwards ordered "the three dominant SOE [state influence enterprises] telecoms [companies] to stop doing business with the company".<br />
Google held out however and refused to block access to Google.com. The US embassy was told that "removing the link to Google.com is against the company's principles".<br />
China subsequently increased its attacks on Google, another cable claims. A group of Chinese internet users reported that Google China was "not effectively filtering pornographic sites" and the Chinese government blocked access to Google for 24 hours.<br />
The documents shed light on the extent of the close working relationship between Google and the US authorities in China. In January, a few days after Google made the hacking public, Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, made a speech in Washington entitled "remarks on internet freedom".<br />
Clinton warned that "countries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century".<br />
She called on the Chinese government to "conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions" without revealing that it was her own officials who believed the attack was co-ordinated from inside the Chinese politburo.<br />
It was revealed yesterday that the online payment service PayPal has suspended the account used by WikiLeaks to collect donations.<br />
The decision follows the publication by WikiLeaks of thousands of leaked US embassy cables.<br />
WikiLeaks accused PayPal, which is based in America, of bowing to US Government demands to withdraw its service. PayPal is one of several methods that enables WikiLeaks to receive donations and finance its operations.<br />
On Wednesday, Amazon ended an agreement to host WikiLeaks, forcing the website to switch to a Swiss internet address on Friday. It had also been dropped by another US internet service provider.

				<b><i> Melbourne. </i></b> Whistleblowing website founder Julian Assange has broken cover to accuse the Australian government of abandoning him to attacks by the US government, the <b>Sydney Morning Herald</b> learned.<br />
From a location in England the Queensland-born Mr Assange questioned what it meant to be an Australian citizen. As the WikiLeaks chief waited for his likely arrest so British authorities could extradite him to Sweden over allegations of rape and sexual molestation - which he denies - he said he missed his country ''a great deal''.<br />
''However, during the last weeks the Australian Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, and the Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, have made it clear that not only is my return impossible but that they are actively working to assist the United States government in its attacks on myself and our people,'' Mr Assange wrote in The Guardian.<br />
''This brings into question what does it mean to be an Australian citizen - does that mean anything at all? Or are we all to be treated like David Hicks at the first possible opportunity merely so that Australian politicians and diplomats can be invited to the best US embassy cocktail parties.''<br />
It was revealed Mr McClelland has also ordered a taskforce of Australian soldiers, intelligence officers and officials to investigate whether Mr Assange and his organisation had breached any Australian laws. ''The publication of this kind of information is incredibly irresponsible and reprehensible,'' Mr McClelland said.<br />
Mr Assange's outburst came as he revealed he had sent the politically sensitive US diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks to 100,000 people and they would be released en masse if the website was brought down.<br />
He said the cables had been copied in encrypted form and would be automatically published online if ''something happens to us''. On Friday, WikiLeaks was forced to move to a Swiss internet address after its website came under a cyber attack.<br />
And he said he had boosted his security after receiving death threats amid the storm unleashed by his site's publication of 250,000 secret US cables.<br />
Scotland Yard and security services know Mr Assange's location, believed to be in south-east England, but have been unable to arrest him because Swedish authorities failed to fill out the arrest warrant correctly.<br />
Swedish prosecutors sent another file containing the missing details.<br />
Mr Assange's lawyer, Mark Stephens, linked the arrest warrant to ''sophisticated'' efforts to take down the website.

				<b><i> Melbourne. </i></b> Julian Assange  is being investigated by Australian police to establish whether he has broken any of the country's laws and is liable to prosecution there, foreign minister Kevin Rudd said Saturday, as quoted by <b>The Guardian</b>.<br />
Washington is furious about WikiLeaks' release of hundreds of its confidential diplomatic cables, which have given unvarnished and sometimes embarrassing insights into the foreign policy of the United States and its allies.<br />
"The federal police was asked by the Australian attorney general some days ago to investigate whether or not Assange has breached any element of the Australian criminal law," Rudd told reporters at a security conference in Bahrain.<br />
If Assange – the Australian founder of WikiLeaks – has broken any Australian laws, his case will be referred to the public prosecutor, Rudd said.<br />
"The Australian government unequivocally condemns the action by any of those responsible for the unauthorised release of classified and confidential information and diplomatic communications between states," he said.<br />
Assange, who is reported to be somewhere in southern England, said on Friday he and colleagues were taking steps to protect themselves after receiving death threats.<br />
One of Assange's lawyers has also said he would fight any attempt to extradite his client to Sweden to face questions over alleged sexual misconduct.<br />
Asked if the Australian authorities were considering withdrawing Assange's passport, Rudd said: "Any action on his passport would be entirely contingent on the recommendations provided by the Australian federal police."

				<b><i>Santo Domingo. </i></b> At least 12 people have been killed in rural Haiti during the past week on accusations they used "black magic" to infect people in a fast-spereading cholera epidemic, <b>Xinhua</b> informed.<br />
Authorities said the victims, most of them were reportedly practitioners of a local faith, were killed by machete-wielding lynch mobs and their bodies were burned in the open, according to news reaching here.<br />
Rumors began to spread last week in the remote southwestern Grand Anse region that the priests had fashioned a magic powder to spread the disease.<br />
The government issued a statement on Thursday, saying "There is no cholera powder, nor cholera spirit" and the priests "can neither treat cholera, nor make a powder that gives cholera."<br />
"The only way to protect one's self against cholera is to observe the principles of hygiene," the statement said.<br />
As of Friday, the fast-killing cholera epidemic had claimed 1,882 victims since its outbreak in mid-October in northern Haiti.<br />
About 84,300 more people were infected with the disease and a majority of provinces in the Caribbean nation have reported cholera cases, official sources said.<br />
Meanwhile, the disease has stretched to neighboring Dominican Republic, which has already announced a red alert in regions bordering Haiti.

				<b><i> Kabul. </i></b> A senior member of Afghanistan's cabinet has warned that the release of leaked US diplomatic cables will damage the country's relations with the US, <b>The Guardian</b> disclosed.<br />
Finance minister Omar Zakhilwal said it would no longer be "business as usual" between the government and US ambassador Karl Eikenberry after the leaking of the dispatches that portray the president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, and his government in a deeply unflattering light.<br />
Zakhilwal also denied a report in a US embassy cable dated 26 February 2010 that he called Karzai an "extremely weak man who did not listen to facts but was instead easily swayed by anyone who came to report even the most bizarre stories or plots against him". The report is "absolutely, categorically wrong and false," the highly regarded minister said.<br />
US diplomats in Kabul are furious with WikiLeaks, and believe the leaked dispatches could do real damage to the vital relationship. Of even greater concern for the Americans is that the private but highly critical remarks about Karzai by some cabinet ministers, including Zakhilwal, could lead to some of the country's few competent administrators losing their jobs.<br />
One western diplomat said it was hard to know whether Zakhilwal would cling on: "In a normal country it would be the honourable thing to tender his resignation, but it's very hard to know."<br />
The US embassy, led by Eikenberry, who described Karzai in classified cables as "a weak individual unfamiliar with the basics of nation-building", has for the last week been engaged in pre-emptive damage limitation.<br />
On Monday Eikenberry released a statement saying: "The US is absolutely committed to building and strengthening a long-term partnership with the Afghan people and the Afghan government. Our shared goals do not change based on the release of purported diplomatic reporting from the past."<br />
The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, also phoned the Afghan president to reassure him of US support.<br />
One official said yesterday the embassy had not yet got over the leaking earlier this year of a cable that argued a troop surge was unlikely to succeed because Karzai's inept style of government meant the Afghan president was "not an adequate strategic partner".<br />
"We never really recovered from the strategic partner cable, and we are worried this will make it worse," the official said. Karzai's spokesman, Waheed Omar, has said that the presidential office was reviewing the documents, but that he did not believe they would strain US-Afghan relations.

				<b><i>New York. </i></b>United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon made an urgent appeal Friday for more money to fight the cholera epidemic in Haiti that has claimed more than 1,800 lives, <b>CNN</b> reported.<br />
The United Nations had asked for $164 million in mid-November. Ban said that only 20 percent had materialized.<br />
The water-borne disease has not spread to all 10 departments or provinces of the impoverished Caribbean nation, but the latest data from the Ministry of Public Health reported 1,882 cholera deaths and almost 85,000 people sickened. The Pan American Health Organization said the good news is that a smaller proportion of infected people are dying.<br />
In the first weeks of the cholera epidemic, which began in late October, the proportion of hospitalized patients dying of cholera was as high as 9 percent, the health organization said. That number is now down to 3.5 percent.<br />

				<b><i>London, England. </i></b>WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange defended its posting of confidential documents Friday, saying that not a single person in the website's four-year publishing history has ever been harmed as a result of material it put online, <b>CNN</b> reported.<br />
"During that time there has been no credible allegation, even by (organizations) like the Pentagon that even a single person has come to harm as a result of our activities," Assange said in written answers to readers' questions posted on the website of the British newspaper The Guardian.<br />
"This is despite much-attempted manipulation and spin trying to lead people to a counter-factual conclusion. We do not expect any change in this regard," Assange said.<br />
He was supposed to have started an online chat at 1 p.m. Almost a thousand comments had been posted, many containing questions, when The Guardian announced it was experiencing technical difficulties.<br />
The newspaper, one of several with early access to the leaked diplomatic cables, had already warned readers that Assange's ability to answer would depend on internet accessibility.<br />

				<b><i>London. </i></b>WikiLeaks faced growing pressure Friday as its founder Julian Assange dealt with a new arrest warrant and death threats, while the website hopped around the globe trying to evade efforts to shut it down, <b>AFP</b> reported.<br />
As the fallout grew from its release of secret US diplomatic cables, the whistleblower site found new domain names in a string of European countries after its original wikileaks.org address was shut down by an American provider.<br />
The elusive Assange, who is believed to be in hiding in Britain, faced fresh trouble as Swedish prosecutors sent out a new international arrest warrant for the 39-year-old Australian over sex assault allegations.<br />
He briefly broke cover Friday in an online forum with readers on The Guardian newspaper to say that if anything happened to him or WikiLeaks then 100,000 encrypted copies of the cables would automatically be released.<br />
"The threats against our lives are a matter of public record. However, we are taking the appropriate precautions to the degree that we are able when dealing with a superpower," Assange wrote. <br />
The Guardian is one of several newspapers publishing extracts from the leaked US memos that WikiLeaks started releasing on Sunday, infuriating Washington and plunging its relations with many countries into turmoil.<br />
A Canadian pundit called earlier this week for Assange to be assassinated, while former US Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee said those responsible for the leaks should face execution.<br />
In Stockholm prosecutors said they had sent a new warrant for Assange that included missing elements in the original warrant requested by the British police. Interpol has also issued an appeal for his arrest.<br />
"They were asking for additional information concerning the maximum penalty for all the crimes and infractions on the file. We usually only include the most severe offence," which was rape in this case, Swedish prosecution office spokeswoman Karin Rosander told AFP.<br />
Assange's lawyer in London, Mark Stephens, said that neither Scotland Yard nor he had received the warrant, adding that given the timescale of the previous warrant he expected it could be up to 10 days before it is served.<br />
British police sources indicated, however, that it could be within "a couple of days."<br />
Stephens linked the warrant to the "sophisticated" cyber attacks and other efforts to take down the website, suggesting that a "state actor" was behind efforts to silence Assange.<br />
Assange denies the sex assault charges, which relate to encounters with two women, and has said they are an attempt to smear him.<br />
The whistleblower site came back online early Friday with a new address in Switzerland, six hours after its previous domain name was shut down by a US system provider because of a series of cyber attacks.<br />
But the Swiss site was down by Friday evening too, and WikiLeaks announced on its Twitter account that it had launched three new addresses in the Netherlands, Germany and Finland (wikileaks.nl; wilileaks.de; wikileaks.fi.)<br />
France's Industry Minister Eric Besson meanwhile called for WikiLeaks to be banned from French servers, after discovering that French web provider OVH was hosting the site.<br />
"France cannot host Internet sites that violate the confidentiality of diplomatic relations and put in danger people protected by diplomatic secrecy," Besson wrote to the main French Internet authority. <br />
Amazon booted WikiLeaks off its computer servers on Wednesday following pressure from US politicians, and a day later a group of senators introduced legislation to make it illegal to publish the names of informants serving the US military and intelligence community. <br />
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has described the leaks as "an attack on the world" and has expressed her regret to Argentine President Cristina Kirchner and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari over their content. <br />
Russia has also been upset by the leaks in which it has been branded a virtual "mafia state" and President Dmitry Medvedev derided as a "Robin" to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's "Batman". <br />
At a press conference on Friday with visiting Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi -- himself a target of some of the cables -- Medvedev said the cables illustrated the "cynicism" of US foreign policy. <br />
Assange, meanwhile, promised that further revelations would be out of this world. <br />
"It is worth noting that in yet-to-be-published parts of the 'cablegate' archive there are indeed references to UFOs," he wrote on The Guardian's website.<br />

				<b><i>Port-au-Prince. </i></b>Irregularities in Haiti's elections seem "more serious than initially thought," U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Friday, urging candidates and their supporters to respect the law and avoid violence, <b>Reuters</b> reported.<br />
Ban briefed the U.N. General Assembly in New York on the situation in Haiti, where several days of protests and unrest have followed confused presidential and legislative elections held last Sunday during a cholera epidemic.<br />
"Whatever the complaints or reservations about the process, I urge all political actors to refrain from violence and to start discussions immediately to find a Haitian solution to these problems -- before a serious crisis develops," Ban said.<br />
Preliminary election results are due to be announced on Tuesday, which the international community hopes can produce a stable, legitimate government to lead the recovery of the poor Caribbean country from a devastating January 12 earthquake.<br />
The presidential contest, which featured 18 candidates, is expected to go to a runoff, probably on January 16.<br />
Haitian electoral authorities met in Port-au-Prince with the candidates, a big group of whom -- excluding the front-runners identified by opinion polls -- have called for annulment of the elections.<br />
This group of candidates also denounced "massive fraud," an allegation criticized by the world body and election monitors.<br />
While acknowledging a range of voting problems, Provisional Electoral Council Director General Pierre-Louis Opont said the vast majority of voters were able to cast their ballots.<br />
"The council has decided to move on with the process," he said, adding that would include a second round as required.<br />
Ban said, "While some violence and disruptions on election day are not exceptional in Haiti, the irregularities now seem more serious than initially thought."<br />
Organization of American States/Caribbean Community election observers said they detected a number of irregularities, some serious, in the vote but declared they did not necessarily invalidate the process.<br />
Amid scenes of confusion on Sunday in the capital, many frustrated voters were unable to find the polling stations where they were registered, while a number of stations opened late or lacked the necessary electoral materials or staff.<br />
Up to three people were killed in electoral violence, while at least one polling station was trashed by protesters.

				<b><i> Moscow. </i></b> Julian Assange, the enigmatic founder of the WikiLeaks, said it could take at least seven years to study all secret materials archived by his whistleblower website, <b>RIA Novosti</b> disclosed.<br />
WikiLeaks made public on Monday more than 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables, which contain, in particular, harsh comments about many world leaders.<br />
Speaking in a video interview with the Russian Reporter magazine, Assange said that the leaked documents were just a small portion of the materials that he has, and more "waves" should be expected in the next month-and-a-half.<br />
The 39-year-old Australian activist said WikiLeaks "only scratched the surface" and it could take as long as seven years to thoroughly study the documents that shed light on many important events in many countries.<br />
The recent publication of secret documents caused media stir, but world leaders and diplomats unanimously downplayed the impact of the information leak on international relations.<br />
Assange said their reaction was predictable, but these facts would attract more and more public attention in the future, leaving less room for "plausible denial."<br />
Russian Reporter is a partner of the WikiLeaks website in Russia.

				<b><i> Stockholm. </i></b> Sweden says it will issue a fresh arrest warrant for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as new revelations from his website's expose of US diplomatic cables saw Russia branded a "mafia state", <b>AFP</b> reports.<br />
While the elusive whistleblower laid low, his British lawyer insisted on Thursday police knew his whereabouts and it emerged that an initial warrant was defective.<br />
After the Supreme Court in Stockholm refused to hear an appeal by Assange against the initial warrant over allegations of rape and molestation, Swedish police said they would issue a new one as a result of a procedural error.<br />
"It's a procedural fault," Tommy Kangasvieri of the Swedish National Criminal Police told AFP. "The prosecutor, Marianne Ny, has to write a new one."<br />
While Assange has not been seen in public since WikiLeaks began leaking about 250,000 cables on Sunday, his London-based lawyer Mark Stephens denied he was on the run.<br />
"Scotland Yard know where he is, the security services from a number of countries know where he is," Stephens told AFP.<br />
"The (British) police are being slightly foxy in their answers, but they know exactly how to get in touch with him, as do the Swedish prosecutors."<br />
Britain's Times newspaper said Assange was at a location in southeast England although there was no confirmation from Stephens.<br />
After former US vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin said the WikiLeaks team should be treated like a terrorist organisation, a spokesman for the website said Assange feared for his life.<br />
"When you have people calling, for example, for his assassination, it is best to keep a low profile," Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London, after right-wing US websites and pundits called for him to be assassinated.<br />
Assange's mother also expressed fear for her son's safety.<br />
"I'm concerned it's gotten too big and the forces that he's challenging are too big," Christine Assange told the Courier Mail, her local newspaper in Queensland, Australia.<br />
Assange's Stockholm-based lawyer Bjoern Hurtig told AFP Thursday he would fight his client's extradition to Sweden in the event of his arrest.<br />
The US State Department's spokesman described Assange as an "anarchist" as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to smooth feathers ruffled by the leaks as she toured Central Asia.<br />
Some of the most eye-catching of the latest revelations centred on Russia, with one memo quoting a Spanish prosecutor describing it as a virtual "mafia state" whose political parties operate "hand in hand" with organised crime.<br />
Jose Gonzalez, who has been investigating Russian organised crime in Spain for a decade, also agreed with poisoned dissident Alexander Litvinenko's thesis that Russian intelligence and security services "owned organised crime."<br />
In a separate leaked cable sent shortly after Litvinenko's death in London in 2006, US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried questioned whether Russian Prime Minister Putin knew beforehand of the plot to kill the dissident.<br />
In a meeting with a senior French diplomat, Fried asked "whether rogue security elements could operate... without Putin's knowledge", given the leader's "attention to detail."<br />
The cables have also quoted Defense Secretary Robert Gates as saying "Russian democracy has disappeared" and describing President Dmitry Medvedev as "Robin" to Putin's "Batman".<br />
But in an interview with CNN, Putin said Gates was "deeply misled" and warned US officials not to "interfere" in Russia's internal politics.<br />
Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva also had sharp words for Washington, saying the cables highlighted US hubris.<br />
"They have laid bare a mindset in which the Americans thought they were better than other," he told Brazilian radio.<br />
As the leaks piled on embarrassment for his administration, President Barack Obama named Russell Travers, an anti-terrorism expert, to lead efforts to mitigate the damage and prevent future illegal data disclosures.<br />
The State Department has temporarily suspended Pentagon access to some documents. WikiLeaks is believed to have obtained the cables from Bradley Manning, a disgruntled army intelligence officer.<br />
WikiLeaks was thrown off its web host, Amazon, best known as a book retailer. After several hours, WikiLeaks was again accessible in the United States via a European server.

				<b><i>Astana.</i></b> There are disturbing things in the published documents on WikiLeaks, that is what President Georgi Parvanov said in Astana, <b>BNR</b> announced. Asked about the published documents on WikiLeaks website showing that the U.S. State Department was interested whether there are links to politicians by the previous government with Russian businessmen in energy, Georgi Parvanov said: "I have not commented this issues with Mrs. Clinton. Of course there are disturbing things. Even in what is already realized at the time. But as far as there is an interest for relations with the questionable Russian media, I paid attention to the U.S. side to publications that were in the Bulgarian press ten years ago. Then documents about party foundations emerged, family foundations. These things I say, documented, should enter in the accounts of the U.S. Embassy. This is a joke, of course. I hope the documents that will be published, to contain no things that to cast a shadow, erode trust between the two allied countries. " <br />
Georgi Parvanov made these comments on departure from the Kazakh capital Astana, where he participated in the Summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. <br />

				<b><i>Moscow. </i></b>Iran has finished loading fuel into the core of the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, Russia's contractor Atomstroiexport said on Thursday, <B> RIA Novisti</B> reported.<br />
Ali Akbar Salehi, the chief of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AOEI), said earlier on Thursday the fueling process had been completed and the reactor had been capped, according to Iran's Press TV.<br />
The reactor will be able to generate 1,000 megawatts of electricity within the next six to nine months, Salehi said.<br />
Russia helped Iran launch Bushehr on August 21 after decades of construction delays.<br />
Under a bilateral agreement, which has received approval from the International Atomic Energy Agency, Russia will initially operate the plant, supplying its fuel and taking away all the spent fuel for the next two or three years, but will eventually hand over full control to Iran.<br />

				<b><i>Stockholm. </i></b>Swedish police said Thursday they would issue a new international arrest warrant for Julian Assange to replace one that could not be enforced in Britain because of a procedural error.<br />
"We have to refresh the warrant. It's a procedural fault, we agree. The prosecutor Marianne Ny has to write a new one," Tommy Kangasvieri of the Swedish National Criminal Police told <B>AFP</B>.<br />
"The procedure demands that the maximum penalty for all crimes Assange is suspected for is written" in the warrant, he explained. "We described it only for the rape."<br />

Britain's Times newspaper reported Thursday that British police knew where the Internet whistleblower was -- believed to be a location in southeast England -- but could not act on the information as the European arrest warrant was incorrectly filled out. <br />
The global police agency Interpol said Wednesday it had alerted member states to arrest WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange on suspicion of rape on the basis of a Swedish arrest warrant.<br />
"There is a public 'Red Notice' on behalf of Sweden," a spokeswoman told AFP, confirming that Interpol had posted Sweden's request for assistance in tracking down the 39-year-old Australian on its website.<br />
The Stockholm district court had ordered on November 18 an arrest warrant for Assange for questioning on suspicion of "rape, sexual molestation and unlawful coercion" in Sweden in August.<br />
The court order authorized Ny, who had requested Assange's detention, to prepare an international arrest warrant for the famous hacker, who travels constantly.<br />
Separately Sweden's Supreme Court said Thursday it had refused to hear Assange's appeal to overturn the district court ruling, which was his last possible chance to bloc the warrant.<br />
Assange's lawyer had taken the case to Sweden's Supreme Court on Tuesday, after a first petition was rejected by the Stockholm Appeals court in November.<br />
Whistleblowing website WikiLeaks started publishing some 250,000 US embassy cables on Sunday, which has infuriated Washington and embarrassed many governments worldwide.<br />

				<b><i>Moscow. </i></b> Russian gas giant Gazprom behaves "like a vulture" in its attempts to gain new assets, notorious WikiLeaks cables from the new tranche of the leaked documents said, cited by <B> RIA Novosti</B>. <br />
Among the newly released WikiLeaks materials there are several items covering the practices of Russian state corporations.<br />
WikiLeaks cited U.S. Ambassador to Kazakhstan Richard Hoagland, who in a private conversation with the then first vice-president of the Kazakh state-owned oil and gas producer KazMunaiGaz, Maksat Idenov, said that Gazprom and China National Petroleum Company "continue to circle like vultures," referring to their bids for the world's biggest oil field in Kazakhstan, Kashagan.<br />
The Kashagan Field, one of the largest recent discoveries of oil in the world, has at least a 7-billion-barrel oil capacity. It is currently operated by Italy's Eni SpA. Kazakhstan holds 16.81% in the project as well as the Italian Eni, France's Total, the U.S. Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell. Japan's Inpex has 7.56%, while ConocoPhillips has 8.4%.<br />
WikiLeaks also mentioned Russia's relations with the Customs Union member states. The whistle-blower website claimed that Moscow insisted Astana and Minsk should buy Airbus jets (since the state-owned Russian investment bank Vnesheconombank (VEB) owns 5% of Airbus' producer) instead of Boeing aircraft.<br />
"There is so much fuss about these leaks only because the documents were tagged secret. However, if the ordinary user surfs Internet publications, he will find similar facts from public sources and media," the deputy head of the Center for Political Technologies, Alexei Makarkin, said.<br />
Makarkin said he had not learned "anything knew about Russia from WikiLeaks revelations."<br />

				<b><i>London. </i></b> WikiLeaks chief Julian Assange has evaded arrest in Britain because Swedish authorities made a mistake when filling in his arrest warrant, The Times newspaper reported Thursday, <b>AFP</b> reported.<br />
The paper said that British police knew where the Internet whistle-blower was - believed to be a location in southeast England - but could not act on the information as the European arrest warrant was incorrectly filled out.<br />
Swedish authorities issued the warrant - in connection with alleged sex offences - on November 19, a day before Interpol placed him on their wanted list.<br />
However, a police source told the paper the warrant was unenforceable.<br />
"It is not a properly certified warrant so we can’t act on it," the source said.<br />

				<b><i>Moscow. </i></b>Russia is a corrupt, autocratic kleptocracy centred on the leadership of Vladimir Putin, in which officials, oligarchs and organised crime are bound together to create a "virtual mafia state", according to leaked secret diplomatic cables that provide a damning American assessment of its erstwhile rival superpower, <b>The Guardian</b> reported.<br />
Arms trafficking, money laundering, personal enrichment, protection for gangsters, extortion and kickbacks, suitcases full of money and secret offshore bank accounts in Cyprus: the cables paint a bleak picture of a political system in which bribery alone totals an estimated $300bn a year, and in which it is often hard to distinguish between the activities of the government and organised crime.<br />

				<b><i> Beijing. </i></b> China is blocking attempts to issue a UN Security Council condemnation of North Korea over its attack on the rival South or its new nuclear activities, diplomats said, as quoted by <b>AFP</b>.<br />
The deadlock has become so great that daily Security Council contacts on North Korea since the North's deadly artillery assault on November 22 were not held on Tuesday.<br />
"There were no talks - neither formal nor informal - and nothing else is planned," said one diplomat on Tuesday.<br />
China is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council which can veto any resolution. It is also North Korea's closest international ally and has only reluctantly agreed to sanctions against the Pyongyang regime.<br />
There has been international condemnation of the North's shelling of the island of Yeonpyeong last week, in which two South Korean marines and two civilians were killed.<br />
The United States and other western nations say that North Korea's parallel announcement that it is building a new uranium enrichment plant is a contravention of Security Council resolutions passed after the North's nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009.<br />
"Against the wishes of the vast majority of the Security Council members, China is blocking any action on the uranium enrichment plant and there is not much hope of any talk about the attack," said a second diplomat.<br />
"It says it is unacceptable to 'condemn' or even 'express concern' over North Korea. Council talks have come to a standstill.<br />
"It is now very likely that the Security Council will do nothing about North Korea," the diplomat added.<br />
No official from the Chinese mission was immediately available to comment on the Security Council negotiations.<br />
After the sinking of a South Korean corvette, the Cheonam, in March this year it took four months to pass a resolution which diplomats said was weakened at China's demand.

				<b><i> Pyongyang. </i></b> North Korea has boasted of running "thousands" of nuclear centrifuges, a week after launching a deadly artillery attack on South Korea, as China pressed for six-nation crisis talks, <b>AFP</b> reports.<br />
State media in the North, which has already tested two atomic bombs made from plutonium, said on Tuesday "many thousands of centrifuges" are operating to enrich uranium at a new plant which it claims is for peaceful energy purposes.<br />
The country first disclosed the new plant to US experts less than two weeks before its artillery assault, which killed two civilians and two marines on South Korea's Yeonpyeong island near the disputed Yellow Sea border.<br />
Experts and senior US officials fear the plant could easily be configured to make weapons-grade uranium.<br />
Analysts say the nuclear revelation and artillery attack appeared co-ordinated to pressure Washington and Seoul into resuming dialogue and aid, and possibly to bolster the credentials of leader-in-waiting Kim Jong-Un.<br />
For a third day, the US and South Korean navies staged war games far south of the border involving 11 ships, air power and 7,300 personnel.<br />
South Korea is separately strengthening artillery and troop numbers on frontline islands near the tense frontier. It will hold more drills next week close to the border, though not near Yeonpyeong, the Yonhap news agency said.<br />
The North's state media blasted the naval drill, calling it provocative and warmongering.<br />
"We have full deterrence to destroy our enemies at once," said cabinet newspaper Minju Chosun. "If the US and South Korean enemies dare to fire one shell in our territory and sea territory, they will have to pay for it."<br />
Citing a statement from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Yonhap said that more live fire exercises would take place from December 6 to 12 including near Daechong island close to the frontier.<br />
China has refused publicly to condemn its ally for the shelling, instead suggesting emergency consultations between envoys to the stalled six-nation talks on the North's nuclear disarmament.<br />
Foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said on Tuesday it was imperative "to bring the issue back to the track of dialogue and consultation" as soon as possible.<br />
The White House, which had already dismissed such talks as a "PR activity" unless Pyongyang moderates its activities, said that China had an "obligation" to press North Korea to end its "belligerent behaviour".<br />
"The Chinese have a duty and obligation" to impress "on the North Koreans that their belligerent behaviour has to come to an end", White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters.<br />
Japan's foreign minister has also faulted China's proposal.<br />
South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak, in a toughly worded speech on Monday, did not mention China's suggestion in what some saw as an implicit rejection.<br />
"We should recognise that (South Korea) is confronting the world's most belligerent group," he told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.<br />
Almost 100 South Korean marine veterans landed on Yeonpyeong island on Tuesday, vowing to defend it, ferret out spies -- and feed abandoned dogs.<br />
"Execute Kim Jong-Il, Jong-Un," read a banner they erected after arriving by ferry, in reference to the North's leader and heir apparent.<br />
Elsewhere, activists sent balloons with anti-Pyongyang leaflets, DVDs and one-dollar bills floating into the North across the heavily fortified frontier, urging people to rise up against the hardline regime.<br />
With the nuclear disclosure and the bombardment, the North's leaders "demonstrated their ability to create trouble more or less with impunity", North Korea expert Andrei Lankov wrote in a commentary.<br />
Diplomatic efforts were continuing, however.<br />
Seoul's foreign ministry said its minister Kim Sung-Hwan would attend a Kazakhstan summit of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe on Wednesday and Thursday where he was expected to meet US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.<br />
And two top North Korean officials arrived in Beijing on Tuesday, South Korean and Japanese media said.

				<b><i>Port-au-Price. </i></b>Haiti's general election on Sunday was valid despite "serious irregularities", international observers have said, cited by the <b>BBC</b>.<br />
The joint mission from the Organisation of American States and the Caribbean regional grouping, Caricom, said delays at some polling stations were not reason enough to cancel the election.<br />
Most opposition presidential candidates had called for the vote to be annulled because of alleged vote-rigging.<br />
But the two leading candidates later withdrew their objections.<br />
The election is seen as crucial to the future of Haiti, which is battling a cholera epidemic and trying to rebuild after January's devastating earthquake.

				<b><i>Washington. </i></b>China, long viewed as North Korea's protector, increasingly doubts its own influence and would support the peninsula's reunification if the regime collapses, leaked US documents have said, <b>AFP</b> reported.<br />
Over an expansive dinner last year, the Chinese ambassador to Kazakhstan revealed that Beijing considers North Korea's nuclear program to be "very troublesome," according to a memo obtained by whistle-blower site WikiLeaks.<br />
Ambassador Cheng Guoping "said China hopes for peaceful reunification in the long-term, but he expects the two countries to remain separate in the short-term," said the leaked cable by US Ambassador Richard Hoagland and reprinted by Britain's The Guardian newspaper.<br />
In another cable reproduced by The New York Times, a Chinese official whose name was removed said that Beijing believed North Korea had "gone too far" after carrying out its second nuclear test and firing a missile.<br />
The official told a US diplomat "that Chinese officials had expressed Chinese displeasure to North Korean counterparts and had pressed (North Korea) to return to the negotiation table," it said.<br />
"Unfortunately," the Chinese official was quoted as saying, "those protests had had no effect."<br />
"'The only country that can make progress with the North Koreans is the United States,'" the Chinese official was quoted as saying.<br />
WikiLeaks has outraged the US government with its massive release of sensitive data. The memos became public a week after North Korea shelled a South Korean border island, killing four people and sending tensions soaring.<br />
The standoff comes as North Korea's reclusive leader Kim Jong-Il, who has suffered a stroke, prepares to hand over power to his little-known youngest son Kim Jong-Un, who is believed to be in his late 20s.<br />
Dai Bingguo, China's state councilor, is quoted in a cable as telling US officials after a visit to Pyongyang that Kim Jong-Il had lost weight but "appeared to be in reasonably good health and still had a 'sharp mind.'"<br />
Kim said he still drank alcohol, saying that only scheduling problems stopped the North Korean leader from partaking with his guest in one of his legendary drinking sessions, according to the cable.<br />
Many US experts believe that China wants to preserve the status quo on North Korea, fearing that a collapse would trigger a flood of refugees and bring a united and US-allied Korea to its border.<br />
But senior South Korean official Chun Yung-Woo is quoted in a cable as saying that more "sophisticated" Chinese officials have come to believe that North Korea "has little value to China as a buffer state" since its first nuclear test in 2006.<br />
Chun also said that South Korea believed that North Korea "had already collapsed economically" and would "collapse politically" two to three years after Kim's death.<br />
Chun, who was then vice foreign minister and is now national security adviser, said that China "had far less influence on North Korea than most people believe."<br />
"Beijing had 'no will' to use its economic leverage to force a change in Pyongyang's policies and the (North Korean) leadership knows it," he said.<br />
However, another cable quoted a Chinese official who "discounted strongly any suggestion that the system would collapse once Kim Jong-Il disappeared."<br />
The unnamed official "cautioned that US experts should not assume North Korea would implode after Kim Jong-Il's death," it said.<br />

Comparing the documents to the emails that exposed Enron's dealings amid its collapse, the controversial Australian said an existing "big US bank" was the subject of a pending data dump.<br />
Asked about any future leaks, he said: "Yes. We have one related to a bank coming up, that’s a megaleak. It's not as big a scale as the Iraq material, but it’s either tens or hundreds of thousands of documents depending on how you define it."<br />

				<b><i>Moscow, Russia. </i></b>Diplomatic cables released by the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks offer a rare glimpse into the sensitive relationship between the United States and Russia, particularly over past negotiations on Iran's nuclear program, <b>CNN</b> reported.<br />
In one confidential assessment, sent on October 6, 2009, the U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Beyrle, complains of a "stubborn mentality" among Russian officials, that "instinctively opposes making common cause with the West over Iran."<br />
As the United States worked to build an international consensus over the need for tougher sanctions on Tehran, the cables illustrate growing frustrations in Russia with Iran, as well as a growing sense among Russian policy-makers and analysts that Moscow's influence over Tehran was slipping.<br />
In a cable sent on December 14, 2009, and following backsliding by Iran over an apparent agreement on uranium enrichment, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is reported to have told Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi that dealing with Iran was "frustrating" and that he "did not know who was making decisions in Tehran now."<br />
In a separate observation, a senior official at Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry, Ali Mustafabeily, describes the Iranians as "sly," adding that they knew how to negotiate.<br />
In another candid assessment, Beyrle remarks that Russia's reliance on oil and gas revenues creates what he calls an "instability premium" favoring Russian economic interests. If tension over Iran pushes the price of oil up by $5, Beyrle notes, that equates to an increase of $11-13 billion per year in income for Russia's oil and gas producers.<br />

Colonel Dave Lapan told reporters that the Defense Department had tightened procedures for handling sensitive information but he did not expect changes to rules on who is permitted access to secret documents.<br />
The WikiLeaks website, which posted more than 250,000 classified documents on Sunday full of embarrassing details of diplomatic exchanges, has never revealed its source in a series of document dumps but suspicion has focused on a US Army private working in military intelligence, Bradley Manning, who is now under detention.<br />
Given Manning's low rank, the Pentagon has faced questions over how it handles security clearances and secret information. But Lapan said the military was trying to achieve a "balance between security and information-sharing."<br />
"Remember in the aftermath of 9/11, one of the major criticisms was that we had stovepipes and information wasn't being shared," he said.<br />
"Only so many procedures can be put into place. Ultimately it's the responsibility of individuals to follow those."<br />
The Defense Department on Sunday announced a series of measures to crack down on potential leaks, which included disabling all write capability for removable media on classified computers, restricting transfers of information from classified to unclassified systems and better monitoring of suspicious computer activity using similar tactics employed by credit card companies.<br />
"It is impossible to know under what circumstances someone might be able to defeat the systems that are in place," Lapan said."So I couldn't guarantee that it (another leak) wouldn't happen, but the safeguards and procedures being put into place certainly lessen that chance."<br />

				<b><i>Moscow. </i></b> The documents relating to Russia released on Monday by the WikiLeaks whistle blowing website do not merit comment, the Russian president's press secretary Natalia Timakova said on Monday, cited by <B> RIA Novosti</B>.<br />
"There is nothing interesting or worth commenting on in the publications released on the WikiLeaks website and in the papers," Timakova said.<br />
"Fictional Hollywood heroes hardly deserve comment," Timakova said, in reference to a document leaked from the U.S. embassy in Moscow that claimed Russian President Dmitry Medvedev "plays Robin" to his strongman Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's "Batman." Another document called Medvedev "pale and hesitant" in comparison to the "alpha-dog" Putin.<br />
Despite Putin's authoritarian image, there were also suggestions in the documents that the former KGB man was finding it tough to prevent his decisions getting bogged down in Russia's notorious bureaucracy.<br />

				<b><i>Teheran. </i></b> Iran's president has dismissed as propaganda the leaking of US cables detailing Arab calls for Washington to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities, <B> BBC</B> reported. <br />
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the release by the Wikileaks website of thousands of extracts from US diplomatic messages was simply psychological warfare against Iran. <br />
He said the release would not affect Iran's relations with other countries.<br />
The US said the release was "reckless" and put the lives of diplomats at risk.<br />
One Republican congressman called for Wikileaks to be designated a terrorist organisation, and the US Department of Defense says it is making its computer systems more secure to prevent future leaks.<br />
The founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, said the US authorities were afraid of being held to account.<br />
European nations have roundly criticised the leaks, with France saying they represent a threat to democratic authority. <br />
Pakistan's foreign ministry, meanwhile, condemned what it called "the irresponsible disclosure of sensitive official documents".<br />
Among the revelations is a report that King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia had urged the US to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities.<br />

				<b><i>Washington. </i></b>The U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks offer unvarnished insights into the personal proclivities of world leaders and how American diplomats privately view them, <B> Washington Post </B> announced.  <br />
According to one such memo, Moammar Gaddafi, the leader of Libya, has an intense dislike of staying above the first floor of hotels and cannot climb more than 35 steps. His fear of flying creates logistical headaches for his staff, who make great attempts to avoid long flights over water. <br />
And Gaddafi is reportedly obsessively dependent on traveling with a Ukrainian nurse described as a "voluptuous blonde" because she alone "knows his routine." <br />
The details on Gaddafi were included in a State Department cable in September 2009 during the leader's visit to New York for the United Nations General Assembly. <br />
In the cable, Gene A. Cretz, U.S. ambassador to Tripoli, concluded: "While it is tempting to dismiss his many eccentricities as signs of instability, Qadhafi is a complicated individual who has managed to stay in power for forty years through a skillful balancing of interests and realpolitik methods." <br />
This is one of many distinctly undiplomatic sketches of the world's leading statesmen contained in the documents released Sunday. Among the highlights, as reported by Britain's Guardian newspaper: <br />
U.S. diplomats quoted sources describing North Korean leader Kim Jong Il as a "flabby old chap" and someone who had suffered "physical and psychological trauma" as a result of his stroke. <br />
French President Nicholas Sarkozy, in the view of U.S. diplomats in Paris, has a "thin-skinned and authoritarian personal style" because of his tendency to rebuke his team and the French prime minister. <br />
 An official at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow wrote in late 2008 about the relationship between Russian President Dimitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin that Medvedev "plays Robin to Putin's Batman." <br />
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is "feckless, vain and ineffective as a modern European leader," according to a U.S. official in Rome. Another cable remarked on Berlusconi's "frequent late nights and penchant for partying hard." <br />
Afghan President Hamid Karzai is described in one cable from Kabul as "an extremely weak man who did not listen to facts but was instead easily swayed by anyone who came to report even the most bizarre stories or plots against him." <br />

				<b><i>Washington.</i></b> Secret American intelligence assessments have concluded that Iran has obtained a cache of advanced missiles, based on a Russian design, that are much more powerful than anything Washington has publicly conceded that Tehran has in its arsenal, diplomatic cables show, <B> New York Times</B> announced, as based on wikileaks data. <br />
Iran obtained 19 of the missiles from North Korea, according to a cable dated Feb. 24 of this year. The cable is a detailed, highly classified account of a meeting between top Russian officials and an American delegation led by Vann H. Van Diepen, an official with the State Department’s nonproliferation division who, as a national intelligence officer several years ago, played a crucial role in the 2007 assessment of Iran’s nuclear capacity. <br />
The missiles could for the first time give Iran the capacity to strike at capitals in Western Europe or easily reach Moscow, and American officials warned that their advanced propulsion could speed Iran’s development of intercontinental ballistic missiles. <br />

				<b><i>Seoul. </i></b> South Korea will make the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) pay for any further provocation as tolerance in the past has only resulted in bigger provocations, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said Monday, <b>Xinhua</b> informed.<br />
"(We) have come to realize it's hard to expect North Korea ( DPRK) to voluntarily give up on its military brinkmanship and nuclear program," Lee said in a nationally televised public speech Monday morning. "South Koreans now know further patience and tolerance will only encourage even bigger provocations," he said. "We will make sure that the North pays for its future provocations. "<br />
The speech came after the two former wartime rivals exchanged fire last week in waters off the divided peninsula near a disputed maritime border. The DPRK shelled a South Korean border island, killing two marines and two civilians.<br />
Lee, who called the artillery bombardment "inhumane," urged national unity and pledged to push for a defense reform designed to shore up the military. The five northernmost islands in the Yellow Sea, deemed vulnerable to the DPRK's future provocations, will also be closely guarded, the president said.<br />
The speech coincided with the ongoing military drills between South Korea and the United States, the latest show of force aimed at deterring Pyongyang's potential aggression. The two allies have said the exercises, planned after the DPRK's alleged torpedo attack in March on a South Korean warship, are "defensive in nature."<br />
Pyongyang, calling its artillery shelling of the island a " defensive measure," warned of a strike against the joint maneuvers. The four-day navy drills, launched on Sunday, mobilize the 97,000- ton aircraft carrier George Washington.

				<b><i> Port-au-Prince. </i></b> Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council said it had validated Sunday's vote in 96 percent of all polling stations, amid protests alleging fraud and presidential candidates urging the election to be scrapped, <b>AFP</b> reports.<br />
The CEP said that all but 56 of the country's 1,500 stations were approved, and the council president Gaillot Dessainvil called the election "successful."<br />
Thousands of Haitian protesters took to the streets of the capital on Sunday to demand that pivotal national elections be scrapped after accusations the ruling party rigged the polls in a conspiracy with the CEP.<br />
UN officials Sunday expressed "deep concern at numerous incidents" that disrupted Haiti's pivotal national elections that saw violence and protests over alleged fraud.<br />
"The United Nations and the international community expressed their deep concern at the numerous incidents that marred the elections," the UN mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) said in a statement.<br />
The UN is "urging" Haitians and political candidates "to remain calm," noting the possible "dramatic consequences" of a deteriorating security situation in the country that is gripped by a cholera epidemic and the aftermath of a devastating January earthquake<br />

				<b><i> Washington. </i></b> The US has ordered its diplomats to play a larger intelligence role by performing espionage work like obtaining the credit card and frequent flyer numbers of foreign dignitaries, according to leaked US documents published on Sunday, <b>AFP</b> disclosed.<br />
Secret cables - leaked by the whistleblower website WikiLeaks and published in the <b>New York Times</b> and <b>The Guardian</b> in Britain, among other newspapers - reveal that US State Department personnel are asked to glean highly personal information from UN officials and key players from countries around the world.<br />
The cables alluding to work usually associated with the Central Intelligence Agency and other spy bodies were sent to embassies in Africa, the Middle East, eastern Europe, Latin America and the US mission to the United Nations.<br />
For example, a classified directive sent to US diplomats under US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's name in July last year sought technical details about the communications systems used by top UN officials, The Guardian said.<br />
These included passwords and personal encryption keys used in private and commercial networks for official communications, it reported.<br />
The New York Times said that one cable signed by Clinton sought "biographic and biometric information on ranking North Korean diplomats" from US diplomats at the US mission to the United Nations in New York.<br />
The Guardian said the directive also sought intelligence on UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's "management and decision-making style and his influence on the secretariat."<br />
Washington also asked for credit card numbers, email addresses, phone, fax and pager numbers and even frequent-flyer account numbers for UN officials, the British daily added.<br />
The secret "national human intelligence collection directive" was sent to US missions at the UN in New York, Vienna and Rome as well as 33 embassies and consulates.<br />
A similar directive issued under Clinton's name in April 2009 sought out details about key figures in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi, according to the Guardian.<br />
The list asked for "biographic and biometric data, including health, opinions toward the US, training history, ethnicity... and language skills of key and emerging political, military, intelligence, opposition, ethnic, religious, and business leaders," said the cable on the Guardian website.<br />
"Data should include email addresses, telephone and fax numbers, fingerprints, facial images, DNA, and iris scans," it said.<br />
The directive also asked for reporting officers in the so-called African Great Lakes states to provide details on airfields, army camps and other military facilities as well as on military equipment.<br />
The New York Times reported that one cable signed by Clinton sought from US diplomats at the US mission to the United Nations in New York "biographic and biometric information on ranking North Korean diplomats".<br />
The New York Times also said the State Department asked for "details about personal relations between Bulgarian leaders and Russian officials or businessmen," in a cable sent last year to the US embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria.<br />
The Guardian said a directive sent to Cairo, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Amman, Damascus and Riyadh demanded the travel plans and vehicles used by leading members of Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.<br />
US embassy officials were instructed in another document to gather details about the military relations countries in central Africa have with China, Libya, North Korea, Iran and Russia, the British daily said.<br />
The document stressed intelligence on the "transfer of strategic materials such as uranium," it said.<br />
It also put a high priority on "details of arms acquisitions and arms sales by government or insurgents, including negotiations, contracts, deliveries, terms of sale, quantity and quality of equipment, and price and payment terms."<br />
State Department spokesman Philip Crowley sought to shoot down the image of diplomats as spies. "Contrary to some WikiLeaks' reporting, our diplomats are diplomats. They are not intelligence assets," he said on his Twitter feed.

				<b><i>Port-au-Prince. </i></b> Opposition candidate Mirlande Manigat, who lead polls of voting intentions in Haiti's election, publicly accused the ruling party of ballot stuffing in the nation's general election on Sunday, <b>Xinhua</b> informed.<br />
In many polling stations the ballot boxes were full before voting started and officials in charge prevented officials from Manigat's party, the Progressive National Democrat Reunion, from entering facilities, she told media.<br />
In some regions, electoral officials had asked those for their electoral preference at the entrance of the facilities and kept out all those who did not say they favored ruling party Inite.<br />
"These are the tricks they are using to create a victory for Jude Celestin," Manigat said. Polls published last week placed Inite's candidate Celestin some 10 percentage points behind Manigat. Manigat called for Haitians not to accept the situation and to seize the stuffed ballot boxes"without violence and within the framework of the law."<br />
On Saturday, Manigat had warned that a "political crisis" would follow any fraud in the nation and called on citizens to ensure that no votes were stolen.<br />
Manigat said that 500,000 additional votes had been stored in order to be used in a fraud and that 500 new polling stations had been set up that were run by Inite staff. She said that the nation' s electoral authority had also switched staff at polling stations in order to benefit the ruling party.<br />
About 4.7 million Haitians eligible to vote in the general election which chooses the nation's next president, 11 of the nation's 13 senators and 99 representatives in the Chamber of Deputies.

				<b><i> Seoul. </i></b> South Korean President Lee Myung-bak on Monday strongly condemned North Korea's recent shelling of a South Korean border island, saying an attack against civilians is an "inhumane" crime strictly prohibited even during a war, <b>Yonhap News Agency</b> reported.<br />
"I can't contain my anger over the North Korean regime's cruelty that ignores even the lives of children," Lee said in a televised speech.<br />
He pledged that Seoul will make Pyongyang pay a price corresponding to any future provocations.<br />
Lee said the North's deadly artillery strike on Yeonpyeong Island, where about 1,400 people resided, shows that it would be hard to expect the communist nation to abandon its nuclear program and military brinkmanship.<br />
Lee appealed to the South Korean people for unity, saying a "unified people" would take national security to its strongest level.

				<b><i> Washington. </i></b> Diplomats are by definition known for the niceties of their public statements, but leaked documents out Sunday show that US officials can be merciless in their assessments behind closed doors, <b>AFP</b> reports.<br />
The thousands of secret cables released by the whistleblower website WikiLeaks feature unflattering descriptions of the leaders of both US allies and adversaries.<br />
Here are some of the more colorful descriptions, as reported by The Guardian, The New York Times and Der Spiegel:<br />
<br />
-- ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER SILVIO BERLUSCONI. A senior US diplomat described him as "feckless, vain, and ineffective as a modern European leader." Another cable called him "physically and politically weak" and said he did not rest properly because of his late-night partying.<br />
<br />
-- AFGHAN PRESIDENT HAMID KARZAI. A cable described Karzai as "extremely weak" and prone to being persuaded by conspiracy theories. Karzai has had a rocky relationship with President Barack Obama.<br />
<br />
-- LIBYAN LEADER MOAMER KADHAFI. A cable says Kadhafi is "almost obsessively dependent on a small core of trusted personnel" and reportedly cannot travel without a particular "voluptuous" Ukrainian nurse. Kadhafi is said to suffer from fears of flying over water and staying on upper floors of buildings.<br />
<br />
-- RUSSIAN PRESIDENT DMITRY MEDVEDEV. Despite officially being the head of state and subordinate to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, the US embassy in Moscow says Medvedev "plays Robin to Putin's Batman."<br />
<br />
-- GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL. A document called her "risk averse and rarely creative." Her vice chancellor and foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, is said to have an "exuberant personality" but little foreign policy know-how.<br />
<br />
-- FRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY. The US embassy called him "thin-skinned and authoritarian," pointing to his rebukes of his team.<br />

				<b><i>Port-au-Prince. </i></b> The vast majority of Haiti' s opposition candidates called for the cancellation of the nation' s election at a press conference held Sunday citing ballot stuffing and other irregularities, <b>Xinhua</b> informed.<br />
Spokeswoman Josette Bijou announced that 17 of the 18 candidates campaigning for the presidency announced they have formed a united front demanding nullification of this electoral process as they consider the process has been full of serious wrongdoing, omissions, disorganization and fraud.<br />

				<b><i>Seoul. </i></b> Seoul will carefully examine China's call to hold emergency six-party talks on North Korea amid heightened tension on the Korean peninsula, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said on Sunday, <B> RIA Novosti</B> reported.<br />
China called for emergency talks among six countries mediating the issue of North Korea's nuclear disarmament after N. Korea had placed surface-to-surface missiles on launch pads in the Yellow Sea and also moved several batteries of SA-2 surface-to-air missiles to coastal areas while South Korea started large-scale military drills jointly with the United States.<br />
The tension on the Korean peninsula tightened after North Korea had opened artillery fire on the South's Yeonpyeong Island in the Yellow Sea Tuesday, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. Sixteen others were injured, along with three civilians. The South retaliated and warned of further strikes. The North later accused South Korea of attacking first.<br />

				<b><i>Seoul. </i></b>North Korea Sunday vowed a "merciless military counter-attack" against any intrusion into its territorial waters as a major US-South Korean naval exercise began well south of the border, <b>AFP</b> reported.<br />
The new threat, from the ruling communist party newspaper Rodong Sinmun, came five days after the North bombarded a South Korean border island, killing two civilians and two marines and setting homes ablaze.<br />
The North said it opened fire last week after South Korean shells landed in its waters around the tense and disputed Yellow Sea border.<br />
"The DPRK (North Korea) will deal a merciless military counter-attack at any provocative act of intruding into its territorial waters in the future, too," said the paper's commentary carried by the official news agency.<br />
The North rejects the Northern Limit Line (NLL) border drawn by United Nations forces after the 1950-53 war and insists it should run further to the south. The area saw deadly naval battles in 1999, 2002 and last November.<br />
The paper said the South's "provocation" was "part of their vicious scheme to defend the brigandish 'northern limit line' by persistently letting their warships into the territorial waters of the DPRK side under the pretext of 'intercepting fishing boats'."<br />
It said a military alert declared by the South after the shelling was intended to shirk responsibility for the shelling and justify its moves to ignite a war.<br />
"Such moves for confrontation and war with the DPRK made by the puppet war maniacs under the pretext of 'defending northern limit line' will bring nothing but shameful self-destruction to them."<br />
The paper did not mention the joint naval exercise which began some 120 kilometres (75 miles) to the south of the border. On Saturday the North had warned of unspecified "consequences" if the war games went ahead.<br />

				<b><i>Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. </i></b>Candidates wound up a flurry of election campaigning before a midnight deadline Friday night amid reports of a violent attack on one of the candidates' campaigns, <b>CNN</b> reported.<br />
The campaign of flamboyant komba-singer-turned-presidential-candidate Michel "Sweet Micky" Martelly issued a statement late Friday night, claiming he had survived an "assassination attempt" in the town of Les Cayes in southern Haiti.<br />
"Many wounded, at least one dead," the campaign said in a press release.<br />
Haitian police officials have not responded to phone calls from CNN. A spokesman for the United Nations confirmed to CNN there had been a clash in Les Cayes late Friday night, though he could not say whether there were casualties involved.<br />
"It's a confrontation between Martelly partisans and the (supporters) of another Init&#233; senator," Jean-Francois Vezina, a spokesman for the United Nations police detachment in Haiti, told CNN Saturday. <br />

				<b><i>Seoul. </i></b>North Korea has deployed SA-2 surface-to-air missiles near its disputed Yellow Sea border with South Korea, a report said Sunday as a major US-led naval exercise began further to the south, <b>AFP</b> reported.<br />
The missiles appear to be targeting the South's jet fighters flying near the Northern Limit Line which marks the border, Yonhap news agency quoted a government source as saying.<br />
The defence ministry declined to comment on the report.<br />
South Korea and the United States Sunday launched a naval drill far south of the border, where four people were killed and 18 wounded in Tuesday's surprise artillery bombardment by the North of Yeonpyeong island.<br />
The ageing Soviet-designed SA-2 missile has a range of 5-19 miles (8-30 kilometres).<br />
Other missiles on the North's west coast, such as the Samlet and Silkworm with ranges of up to 95 kilometres, have also been put onto launch pads, the source was quoted as saying.<br />

				<b><i>Seoul. </i></b>The United States and South Korea Sunday mounted a major show of naval strength to deter North Korea following its deadly shelling attack, despite Pyongyang's warning of unpredictable consequences, <b>AFP</b> reported.<br />
The four-day exercise involving around a dozen warships including a US aircraft carrier began at 8:00 am (2300 GMT Saturday), Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.<br />
It started five days after the North stunned the world by launching a barrage of shells and rockets at a South Korean border island, killing two marines and two civilians and setting homes and forests ablaze.<br />
Washington insists that the drill -- which has been criticised by Beijing -- is defensive in nature and was planned long before last week's attack, but says it is intended to send a message of deterrence to the North.<br />
The drill involving at least 11 major warships and thousands of service personnel was taking place off South Korea's southwest coast, far from the flashpoint inter-Korean border, according to coordinates given by Seoul officials.<br />
"If the US brings its carrier to the West Sea of Korea (Yellow Sea) at last, no one can predict the ensuing consequences," the North's official news agency said Saturday, in the latest of a series of warnings following Tuesday's bombardment.<br />
The drill is one of a series announced in May, after a Seoul-led multinational investigation found overwhelming evidence that a North Korean torpedo sank a South Korean warship earlier in the year.<br />
That incident, which cost 46 lives, sparked anger in the South. But Tuesday's bombardment -- the first time the South's civilian areas have been shelled since the 1950-53 war -- was seen as more shocking.<br />
The North claims it acted in retaliation to a South Korean firing drill in what it regards as its own waters around the contested border.<br />
On Saturday it said the two civilian deaths were "if true... very regrettable".<br />
But it also charged that civilians on Yeonpyeong island -- which is home to a marine base -- had been used as "human shields" by being placed near artillery positions.<br />
Pyongyang has warned that the new war games mean the peninsula "is inching closer to the brink of war". It regularly uses such rhetoric and it was unclear whether it would try to disrupt the drill in any way.<br />
South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak warned Saturday "there is a possibility that North Korea might commit wayward acts during the exercise," according to his spokesman.<br />
Lee has come under pressure to take a tougher line against the North after the military's counter-fire last week was seen as feeble. His defence minister quit last Thursday to take responsibility.<br />
"The intensity of the (naval) exercise will be greater than had been planned," Yonhap news agency quoted a Seoul military source as saying.<br />
"Participating forces will carry out firing and bombing drills."<br />
The 97,000-ton carrier George Washington can carry about 75 aircraft on its 1.8 hectare (4.5 acre) flight deck and has a crew of 5,500.<br />
Also taking part on the US side was an embarked carrier air wing and vessels the USS Cowpens, Lassen, Stethem and Fitzgerald, according to information provided earlier. <br />
Six South Korean warships, including a 7,600-ton Aegis-class destroyer, two 4,500-ton destroyers and frigates, as well as anti-submarine aircraft were joining the drill, a JSC spokesman said. <br />
The drill will also involve a high-flying US J-STARS (joint surveillance and target attack system) surveillance aircraft to monitor the North's military moves, Yonhap reported. <br />
"J-STARS has been deployed to the drill today... the aircraft will monitor (potential) ground targets of the North Korean military," it quoted a senior government official as saying. The JCS declined to confirm the report. <br />
The exercise has raised tensions between Washington and Beijing, which regards the Yellow Sea as its backyard and has refrained from condemning its ally Pyongyang over Tuesday's attack. <br />
Washington has stressed that the manoeuvres are not aimed against China, which hosts stalled six-party talks seeking an end to Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme. <br />
China's state councillor Dai Bingguo travelled to Seoul on Saturday and held talks with Foreign Minister Kim Sung-Hwan. <br />
He will meet President Lee later Sunday, a presidential spokeswoman said without giving details. <br />
Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi held phone talks on Saturday with his Japanese and Russian counterparts.<br />

				<b><i>Washington. </i></b>Governments around the world on Saturday braced for the release of millions of potentially embarrassing US diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks as Washington raced to contain the fallout, <b>AFP</b> reported.<br />
The whistle-blower website is expected to put online three million leaked cables covering US dealings and confidential views of countries including Australia, Britain, Canada, Israel, Russia and Turkey.<br />
US diplomats skipped their Thanksgiving holiday weekend and headed to foreign ministries hoping to stave off anger over the cables, which are internal messages that often lack the niceties diplomats voice in public.<br />
An independent French website reported that the leaks would be published simultaneously at 2130 GMT Sunday by several Western newspapers.<br />
The website, owni.fr, in October launched an interface allowing the public to search, rate and comment on the Iraq war logs, the last major Wikileaks release.<br />
It said the New York Times, Britain's The Guardian, Germany's Der Spiegel, the Spanish El Pais and France's Le Monde would release their first analysis of the documents, but "we expect some leaks before this time," the website's owner said.<br />
The website said Der Spiegel had published the number of documents Saturday afternoon for a few minutes before removing them, saying the release would include 251,287 diplomatic cables, including 16,652 marked "secret."<br />
The top US military commander, Admiral Mike Mullen, urged WikiLeaks to stop its "extremely dangerous" release of documents, according to a transcript of a CNN interview set to air Sunday.<br />
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had contacted leaders in Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, France and Afghanistan over the issue, he added.<br />
WikiLeaks has not specified the documents' contents or when they would be put online, but a Pentagon spokesman said officials were expecting a release "late this week or early next week."<br />
The website has said there would be "seven times" as many secret documents as the 400,000 Iraq war logs it published last month.<br />
In London, the government urged British newspaper editors to "bear in mind" the national security implications of publishing any of the files.<br />
British officials said some information may be subject to voluntary agreements between the government and the media to withhold sensitive data governing military operations and the intelligence services.<br />
Russia's respected Kommersant newspaper said that the documents included US diplomats' conversations with Russian politicians and "unflattering" assessments of some of them.<br />
Turkish media said they include papers suggesting that Ankara helped Al-Qaeda militants in Iraq, and that the United States helped Iraq-based Kurdish rebels fighting against Turkey -- potentially explosive revelations for the two allies. <br />
The US embassy "gave us information on the issue, just as other countries have been informed," a senior diplomat in Ankara told AFP.<br />
Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who traveled to Washington on Saturday for previously scheduled talks with Clinton, said Turkey did not know what the documents contained.<br />
Israel has also been warned of potential embarrassment from the latest release, Haaretz newspaper said, citing a senior Israeli official. <br />
Officials in Canada, Australia, Britain, Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden said they had been contacted by US diplomats regarding the release. <br />
Australia on Saturday condemned the whistle-blower website, saying the "reckless" disclosure could endanger individuals named in the documents as well as the national security interests of the United States and its allies. <br />
US officials have not confirmed the source of the leaked documents, but suspicion has fallen on Bradley Manning, a former army intelligence agent. <br />
He was arrested after the earlier release of a video showing air strikes that killed civilian reporters in Baghdad. <br />
Wired magazine said Manning confessed to the leaks during a webchat in May. He was quoted as saying he acted out of idealism after watching Iraqi police detain men for distributing a "scholarly critique" against corruption. <br />
WikiLeaks argues that the first two document dumps -- US soldier-authored incident reports from 2004 to 2009 -- shed light on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, including allegations of torture by Iraqi forces and reports that suggested 15,000 additional civilian deaths in Iraq. <br />
WikiLeaks is the project of Australian hacker Julian Assange. Sweden recently issued an international warrant for his arrest, saying he is wanted for questioning over allegations of rape and sexual molestation.<br />

				<b><i>Tokyo.</i></b> Philippine President Benigno Aquino has held talks with Japanese Ambassador Makoto Katsura in Manila on the possible immediate evacuation of some 50,000 Filipinos from South Korea to Japan, NHK television reported on Saturday, <b>RIA Novosti</b> reports.<br />
President Aquino's concerns come after reports of a U.S. naval task force led by the George Washington nuclear-powered aircraft carrier that will join South Korean warships in naval exercises on November 28-December 1.<br />
The drills will be held in the wake of a recent military clash between North Korea and South Korea. The South claimed it returned fire after the North opened artillery fire on Yeonpyeong Island in the Yellow Sea on Tuesday, killing at least two South Korean marines and two civilians. Sixteen others were injured, along with three civilians.<br />
Aquino held an extraordinary meeting with government officials to inform them of the need to be prepared for the evacuation of Filipinos living and working in South Korea, adding that their evacuation to the Philippines would take much time and "the closest country to South Korea is Japan."<br />
THK television neither reported on how such an evacuation would occur nor on Japan's actions should it need to accept 50,000 Filipino refugees.<br />
The situation on the Korean Peninsula remains tense and South Korea has boosted its military presence on Yeonpyeong Island.<br />

				<b><i> Washington. </i></b> The United States has raced to contain the fallout from the looming release of millions of sensitive diplomatic cables by the WikiLeaks, warning governments around the world of embarrassing disclosures, <b>AFP</b> reports.<br />
US diplomats headed to foreign ministries in hopes of staving off anger if the whistleblower website puts out the leaked cables, which are internal messages that lack the niceties that diplomats generally voice in public.<br />
The documents, the third tranche since WikiLeaks published 77,000 classified US files on the Afghan conflict in July, could affect some of the most sensitive US relationships including with Russia, Israel and Turkey.<br />
"We are worried about additional documents coming out," US ambassador to Baghdad James Jeffrey told reporters.<br />
"WikiLeaks are an absolutely awful impediment to my business, which is to be able to have discussions in confidence with people. I do not understand the motivation for releasing these documents.<br />
"They will not help, they will simply hurt our ability to do our work here."<br />
Russia's respected Kommersant newspaper said that the documents included US diplomats' conversations with Russian politicians and "unflattering" assessments of some of them.<br />
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that his office has not been officially informed by Washington about the impending file dump, which he blamed on "little thieves running around the internet."<br />
"They steal secret documents there, but we do not get the same thing here - or at least not to the same extent," the Interfax news agency quoted Lavrov as saying.<br />
State Department spokesman Philip Crowley told AFP on Wednesday that the United States was "gearing up for the worst-case scenario" and was informing governments around the world about the possible release of documents.<br />
WikiLeaks has not specified what the tranche of documents pertains to or when it would be released, but Pentagon spokesman Colonel Dave Lapan said US officials were expecting a possible release of documents "late this week or early next week."<br />
The website has so far only said there would be "seven times" as many secret documents as the 400,000 it posted in Iraq war logs published last month.<br />
Among the countries alerted so far about the document release are Britain, Denmark, Israel, Norway and Turkey, officials and reports said.<br />
Washington contacted authorities in Ankara to give "us information on the issue, just as other countries have been informed," a senior Turkish diplomat told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.<br />
According to Turkish media reports, the planned release includes papers suggesting that Turkey helped al-Qaeda militants in Iraq, and that the United States helped Iraq-based separatist Kurdish rebels fighting against Turkey.<br />
Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Turkey did not know what kind of papers the files contained.<br />
"This is speculation," he said on CNN Turk television. "But as a principle, tolerating or ignoring any terrorist action that originates in Turkey and targets a neighbouring country, particularly Iraq, is out of the question."<br />
The Italian government said it was alarmed about "possible negative repercussions for Italy" from the release of the US diplomatic cables.<br />
"I have been informed that the person responsible for leaking the information has been arrested," Foreign Minister Franco Frattini told parliament.<br />
US officials have not confirmed the source of the leaked documents, but suspicion has fallen on Bradley Manning, a former army intelligence agent. He was arrested in May after the release of a video showing air strikes that killed civilian reporters in Baghdad.<br />
Israel has also been warned of potential embarrassment from the latest release, which could include confidential reports from the US embassy in Tel Aviv, Haaretz newspaper said on Thursday, citing a senior Israeli official.<br />
Officials in London, Stockholm and Copenhagen were also all either briefed or contacted by US missions about the impending release, officials in each country said.<br />
WikiLeaks argues the first two document dumps - US soldier-authored incident reports from 2004 to 2009 - has shed light on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, including allegations of torture by Iraqi forces and reports that suggested 15,000 additional civilian deaths in Iraq.<br />
Its announcement on Monday came just days after Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for the website's head, Julian Assange of Australia, wanted for questioning in connection with allegations of rape and sexual molestation.

				<b><i>Seoul. </i></b>North Korea, after its artillery attack on the South this week, warned Friday in its state media that plans for a US-South Korean naval exercise bring the peninsula "closer to the brink of war".<br />
The hardline communist regime on Tuesday fired shells and rockets at the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, killing four people. It later claimed it was retaliating after South Korea had staged military exercises.<br />
US Aircraft carrier the USS George Washington was headed Friday for the Korean peninsula where the US and South Korea plan four days of naval exercises in the Yellow Sea from Sunday, <b>AFP</b> reported.<br />
Washington says the war games had been planned before Tuesday's attack but would aim to highlight the strength of the US-South Korean alliance.<br />
Pyongyang's state-run Korean Central News Agency, in an article Friday on the planned war games, attacked "the US imperialists and south Korean puppet war-like forces" for what it called an exercise in "sabre-rattling".<br />
"The situation on the Korean Peninsula is inching closer to the brink of war due to the reckless plan of those trigger-happy elements to stage again the war exercises targeted against the DPRK," it said, using the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.<br />

				<b><i>Port-au-Prince. </i></b>The head of the UN mission in Haiti said Thursday that if elections pass without incident it will reappraise its peacekeeping mission on the Caribbean nation in the middle of next year.<br />
The UN stabilization mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) has been blamed for a cholera epidemic that has killed more than 1,500 people in the impoverished country, which is struggling to rebuild after a massive earthquake in January, <b>AFP</b> informs.<br />
The Security Council renewed the mission's mandate for another year in October, but MINUSTAH head Edmond Mulet told reporters in Port-Au-Prince that it would take another look at conditions on the ground next spring.<br />
"If we have good elections now and if there is a democratic transfer of power... and the installation of a new national assembly next year, then we will analyze the security situation in the country in April and May 2011."<br />
That process could see a return to "a plan that we established at the end of 2009 for the reduction and eventual departure of the mission," he said.<br />
Mulet said the mission, first established in 2004, had been on track to finish its work in 2009 but was forced to extend its term following the earthquake.<br />
Several candidates in Haiti's upcoming elections, including favorite Mirlande Manigat, have demanded the gradual withdrawal of MINUSTAH.<br />
Many Haitians have accused the UN mission of introducing cholera to the island, saying the outbreak stemmed from Nepalese soldiers, and anti-UN cholera riots erupted last week in the capital's sprawling tent camps.<br />
The UN mission said it had tested the Nepalese and found no trace of the disease, which causes diarrhea, vomiting and rapid dehydration.<br />
Nearly 4.7 million Haitians are eligible to vote in Sunday's presidential elections, which will also see 11 of the country's 30 senators and all 99 parliamentary deputies chosen.<br />
The country could face further chaos and risk billions in international aid if no credible government emerges to replace President Rene Preval, who is legally barred from seeking a third term.<br />
Campaigning has been marred by deadly clashes between rival political factions and by anti-UN riots that have raised fears of wider unrest. Officials have also expressed concern about widespread fraud.<br />

				<b><i>Port-au-Prince. </i></b> The fatalities due to the cholera epidemic outbreak in Haiti have increased to 1,523 from 1, 415 two days ago, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) said on Thursday, <b>Xinhua</b> informed.<br />
PAHO is the Americas' unit of the World Health Organization under the United Nations. According to the organization, the cholera outbreak has also sent 27,933 Haitians to hospital since the first detection of the disease in October.<br />
The disease has caused the deaths of 140 people in Port-au- Prince, Haiti's capital.<br />
More than one million Haitians are living in precarious tents since a devastating earthquake last January, which caused around 250,000 deaths and massive property loss.<br />
PAHO fears that cholera could quickly spread due to the poor sanitary conditions in this island country.<br />
It also warned that the epidemic could last for years and could be even more devastating for the Haitian population.<br />
"We have to prepare ourselves for a drastic increase in the cases of cholera and we have to be sure that there is a quick way to respond in order to treat them," said PAHO's assistant director Jon Andrus.<br />
The cholera outbreak started in the northern Artibonite River valley, a region which was not severely damaged by the Jan. 20 earthquake. The UN has launched an appeal for 160 million U.S. dollars to help combat the disease.

"The president has just accepted the defense minister's resignation," according to a spokesman for the Presidential Blue House. <br />
Kim, a former general, came under heavy criticism after the March sinking of the South Korean war ship Cheonan and again after North Korea struck the South's Yeonpyeong Island on Tuesday. <br />
North Korea has been blamed by the South and other nations for the Cheonan incident, in which 46 sailors were killed, but has denied responsibility. North Korea has blamed South Korea and the United States for the Yeonpyeong incident, in which two South Korean marines and two civilians were killed and 15 others injured. <br />

				<b><i> London. </i></b> An international arrest warrant is being issued for the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, after Swedish prosecutors were today granted permission to detain him for questioning in a rape case, the <b>Guardian</b> disclosed.<br />
The Stockholm district court approved the request after hearing investigators had been unable to question the 39-year-old Australian on suspicion of rape, sexual molestation and unlawful coercion. The allegations, which Assange has repeatedly denied, relate to two women he met while on a visit to Sweden in August.<br />
Stockholm's director of public prosecution, Marianne Ny, said in a statement to the court: "So far, we have not been able to meet with him to accomplish the interrogation." Speaking after the court's decision she said an international arrest warrant would be issued through Interpol.<br />
Counsel for the women, Claes Borgstr&#246;m, told Swedish newspapers that it was "clear that Julian Assange is in hiding."<br />
Assange's whistle-blowing website was behind the biggest leak of US military documents in history.<br />
His London-based lawyer, Mark Stephens, said he had "repeatedly offered to be interviewed, first in Sweden, and then in the UK", including at the Swedish embassy in London and at a police station in the UK, in person or by phone, and by video conferencing and email.<br />
"All of these offers have been flatly refused by a prosecutor who is abusing her powers by insisting he returns to Sweden," Stephens said.<br />
He added that Assange, who has made a number of appearances in London recently, left Sweden after the prosecution told his Swedish lawyer, Bjorn Hurtig "that he was free to leave the country without interview".<br />
According to another source, the Swedish prosecutor had set a date for a formal interview with him, but Assange instead left for London, though did not commit any offence in doing so, where he appeared at a press conference when the Iraq war logs were published. He subsequently decided not to return to Sweden, telling friends he feared he would be arrested if he did so. Stephens denies this account.<br />
Assange was accused of raping one woman and sexually assaulting another woman in separate encounters in Sweden in August. A warrant for his arrest was first issued in August, but dropped within 24 hours when prosecutors said the accusations against him lacked substance. The case was then reopened.<br />
Though no details of the allegations have been released by prosecutors, police leaks said both women had met him in connection with a seminar he gave in Stockholm on 14 August. The women filed their complaints together six days later.<br />
Describing the case as "not a prosecution, but a persecution", Stephens said the Swedish authorities had a "blatant and deliberate disregard" for Assange's rights, and that the allegations were "false and without basis".<br />
He added: "Both women have declared they had consensual sexual relations with our client and that they continued to instigate friendly contact well after the alleged incidents. Only after the women became aware of each other's relationship with Mr Assange did they make their allegations against him.<br />
Media reports had reported the basis for the rape charge "purely seems to constitute a post-facto dispute over consensual, but unprotected sex days after the event," he said.<br />
"My client is now in the extraordinary position that, despite his innocence, and despite never having been charged and despite never receiving a single piece of paper about the allegations against him, one in 10 internet references to the word 'rape' also include his name."<br />
The timing of this latest development raised questions among supporters of Wikileaks. Assange has in recent media interviews been promising further Wikileaks disclosures, particularly about Russia. WikiLeaks angered the Pentagon by releasing thousands of classified US war reports from Afghanistan and Iraq. Assange travelled to Sweden in August to seek international legal protection for his website under Swedish law after WikiLeaks published 90,000 leaked documents about US military activities in Afghanistan from 2004-2010.<br />
The issuing of an international arrest warrant could trigger international efforts to extradite Assange to Sweden.<br />
As one of the first countries to sign up to the European Arrest Warrant scheme in 2004 Sweden can initiate a fast-tracked extradition for Assange from any other EU member state.<br />
The issuing of an international arrest warrant is set to prompt Interpol, the Paris-based international police intelligence-sharing association, to distribute the warrant in its 188 member countries, opening the way for Assange's arrest in countries outside Europe. If he is arrested, Sweden's national authorities would be notified and the country would then be expected to request his extradition to Sweden.<br />
However extraditions from countries which do not fall within the EAW scheme or have their own bilateral agreements are notoriously slow, and do not always result in the arrest and surrender of the wanted person.<br />

				<b><i>Stockholm. </i></b>A Swedish court on Thursday ordered the detention of Julian Assange, the founder of whistle blowing website WikiLeaks, on suspicion of rape and other sexual crimes, allegations he denies, <b>Reuters</b> reported.<br />
Assange's lawyer, Bjorn Hurtig, told journalists after the hearings he expected a European arrest warrant would be issued for Assange, who had sometimes visited Sweden in the past, and that he would probably appeal.<br />
"He maintains his complete innocence," Hurtig said.<br />
He declined to answer questions as to the whereabouts of Assange, an Australian citizen.<br />
"But sooner or later he has to come to Sweden if this continues," Hurtig said.<br />
The prosecutor's office began an investigation into allegations of rape, sexual molestation and unlawful coercion against Assange in September.<br />
"The reason for my request (to the court) is that we need to interrogate him. So far, we have not been able to meet him to carry out the interrogations," said Marianne Ny, leading the case for the Prosecution Authority.<br />
Assange has called the allegations baseless and criticized what he has called a legal circus in Sweden, where he had been seeking to build a base in order to benefit from its strict journalist protection laws.<br />
He has said that he had been warned by Australian intelligence before the charges were brought that he could face a campaign to discredit him.<br />
Hurtig played down talk of a plot. "I don't think so, at least not from the CIA or from any big organization," he told journalists.<br />
WikiLeaks has angered the Pentagon with its releases of documents related to the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br />
The latest leak, in October, was of nearly 400,000 classified U.S. files on the Iraq war, which Assange has said showed 15,000 more Iraqi civilian deaths than thought. Assange said this month he may seek political asylum in Switzerland.
