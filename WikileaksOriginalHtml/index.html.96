				<div class="entry">
					<p>Consider this reverse scenario: four separate planes carrying hundreds of IDF soldiers crash in a single year all due to mysterious circumstances not traceable to mechanical or human failure.  Israeli nuclear scientists die in bombings and under other violent circumstances.  Retired Israeli generals and a deputy defense minister are  kidnapped and spirited to Teheran.  Mysterious explosions at Israeli missile bases leave scores dead.  And a mysterious computer worm leaves the Dimona nuclear reactor virtually incapacitated.  Whenever asked about any of these incidents Iranian politicians and military officers smile knowingly while Iranian media are filled with stories trumpeting the derring-do of its intelligence services.  Finally, various Iranian generals, intelligence directors and political leaders publicly call for regime change in Israel, a full-fledged assault on Israel to force it to renounce its nuclear program, end the Occupation and topple the current government.</p>
<p>Put the shoe on the other foot and think how Israel would react if it came under the type of attack to which Israel is subjecting Iran.  Of course, Israel would react with full scale war.  It would warn Iran that the next such incident would invoke full-fledged hostilities.  And it would be true to its word.  Now compare this with how Iran has reacted to the same types of provocations.  Iran has not declared war on Israel.  It hasn&#8217;t demanded a Security Council session to denounce Israeli aggression.  Iran is keeping its cool relatively well considering what it&#8217;s facing.  Much better than Israel would under similar circumstances.</p>
 everything Mossad thinks it knows about Iran is wrong&#8221;]<img class="  " title="newsweek iran cover" src="http://www.richardsilverstein.com/tikun_olam/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newsweek1.jpg" alt="newsweek iran cover" width="230" height="307" />
<p>On a similar subject, a <a href="http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2007/08/07TELAVIV2652.html" target="_blank">recently released Wikileaks cable</a> reveals that Mossad chief <a class="zem_slink" title="Meir Dagan" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Dagan">Meir Dagan</a> met with Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns in August, 2007.  The unbelievably self-serving nonsense that emerged from Israel&#8217;s chief intelligence official is astounding.  Among other things, he urged the U.S. to join together with Israel on a plan for regime change:</p>
<blockquote><p>Turning to Iran, Dagan observed that it is in a transition period.  There is debate among the leadership between Rafsanjani and Ahmadinejad and their respective supporters.  Instability in Iran is driven by inflation and tension among ethnic minorities.  This, Dagan said, <em>presents unique opportunities, and Israelis and Americans might see a change in Iran</em> in their lifetimes.  As for Iraq, it may end up a weak, federal state&#8230;</p>
<p>Dagan said that more should be done to foment regime change in Iran, possibly with the support of student democracy movements, and ethnic groups (e.g., Azeris, Kurds, Baluchs) opposed to the ruling regime&#8230;Iran&#8217;s minorities are &#8220;raising their heads, and are<br />
tempted to resort to violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dagan urged more attention on regime change, asserting that more could be done to develop the identities of ethnic minorities in Iran.  He said he was sure that Israel and the U.S. could &#8220;change the ruling regime in Iran, and its attitude towards backing terror regimes.&#8221;  He added, &#8220;We could also get them to delay their nuclear project.  Iran could become a <em>normal state</em>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>By which Dagan clearly means a state that is obedient to Israeli and U.S. interests.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is coöperation and coördination between the U.S. and Israel regarding covert ops/destabilization efforts against Iran as this passage of the cable indicates:</p>
<blockquote><p>Covert Measures: Dagan and the Under Secretary agreed not to discuss this approach in the larger group setting.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given all of the information quoted above it seems entirely credible, even certain that the Mossad, with the collaboration of internal dissident forces like Jundallah and Mujuhadeen e-Khalq, have been responsible for the series of bombings, assassinations and attempts against the lives of political leaders and nuclear scientists within Iran.  The grand plan of the Mossad seems to be to combine paralyzing economic sanctions which provoke instability and unrest, with sabotage and political fragmentation to weaken the regime and eventually topple it.</p>
<p>The language of the cable seems to indicate that the U.S. isn&#8217;t quite on board with the regime change aspect of Israel&#8217;s plan.  But certainly Dagan is quite content that existing policy and a few energetic shoves of the right direction will bring an end to the Ayatollah regime and replace it with one that is &#8220;normal&#8221; (whatever that means).  One wonders what might have to be done to create an Israel that its neighbors and the rest of the world might view as &#8220;normal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unfortunate truth for Dagan is that at least so far, his grand scheme has come up short.  While Iran is under increasing economic distress as evidenced by yesterday&#8217;s quadrupling of the price of gasoline and announcement that other critical subsidies for bread and other necessities would be lessened or phased out, Iran remains a coherent, though troubled state.  While the message doesn&#8217;t seem to have been heard in Tel Aviv, the ability of the regime to withstand the discontent following the June election fiasco indicated to any reasonable observer that this was not a political system that would go easily or willingly.  It will take a lot more to topple the mullahs than a couple of bombings and a sabotaged nuclear program.</p>
<p>To put it even more directly, Israeli policy regarding Iran is founded on completely unrealistic, even deluded premises.  As I recently heard former CIA officer <a class="zem_slink" title="Ray McGovern" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_McGovern">Ray McGovern</a> say about U.S. views on Iran&#8217;s nuclear program, Israel&#8217;s approach to Iran is faith-based rather than evidence-based.  And faith-based policy or intelligence is the absolute worst kind.  You can convince yourself of virtually anything if your analysis is not based on rock-solid evidence and reality, as Israel has done.  Faith-based analysis got us into Iraq and to an extent fueled Obama&#8217;s foray into Afghanistan.  Faith-based intelligence policy is hunting down Taliban militants in Pakistan with CIA drones.  None of this will bring the types of changes the U.S. would like to see in the region.  Just as none of the principles Dagan enunciates above will bring the type of result he wishes (a new Iranian regime).</p>

					<p>Blogs like this one could not exist without sources like <a class="zem_slink" title="Wikileaks" rel="homepage" href="http://www.wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a>.  I have had my own Bradley Mannings provide invaluable information which they and I deemed to be vital for my readers to know.  Information which governments and intelligence services like Israel, the Mossad and Shabak did not anyone to know.  That is why it pains me to see the campaign of persecution conducted by the power elites in the U.S. and elsewhere who&#8217;ve forced its web host, Paypal, Amazon, Mastercard and Visa (among others) to buckle under government pressure.</p>
<p>Since I have been the victim of a DOS attack I don&#8217;t relish this form of counterattack, but I must say these corporate monoliths have far more resources at their disposal to fight back and also have engaged in egregious conduct.  I would rather engage in a campaign of shame and boycott against them to hurt their reputation and business plan.  Though these companies are so ubiquitous in their respective fields it&#8217;s hard for any of us to withdraw from Paypal or the credit card system.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/shamir08272010.html" target="_blank">Counterpunch published an expose</a> (and <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/shamir09142010.html" target="_blank">more comprehensively here</a>) about Julian Assange&#8217;s accusers.  The tone and substance of this piece is flippant, self-serving and borderline offensive.  And I feel ambivalent about attacking someone claiming to be a victim of sex abuse.  But some of the material uncovered does make one <a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/2010/12/02/when-it-comes-to-assange-r-pe-case-the-swedes-are-making-it-up-as-they-go-along/" target="_blank">question the motives of at least one of the accusers</a>.  Also, I feel queasy about charging someone with the serious charge of rape as a result of engaging in consensual sex which somewhere in the course of the act became nonconsensual.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t profess to know or care about Julian Assange&#8217;s sex life, though it does seem that a man in such circumstances could behave in a manner much more circumspect than he has chosen.</p>
<p>Aside from all of this, Wikileaks has pierced the veil of government secrecy, especially of governments like the U.S. and Israel whose policymaking apparatus is particulary opaque.  For this reason alone, Assange and Wikileaks deserve our support.  You may still support Wikileaks by bank transfer or mail:</p>

					<p>The problem with writing a blog is that you write one thing one day and by the next it&#8217;s overtaken by events and you have to backtrack and take back almost everything you said the day before.  Such is the case with Julian Assange, about whom I wrote that it would be enormous folly for the U.S. to prosecute him for espionage violations for his role in the Wikileaks episode.</p>
<p>While I stand by what I wrote regarding this, I have to add that Julian Assange is coming across more and more as a semi-delusional personality.  As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/opinion/03iht-edcohen.html?hp" target="_blank">Roger Cohen writes in today&#8217;s NY Times</a>, the guy knows next to nothing about the Middle East or Israeli politics.  You can see that from the nonsense he spouted in a <a href="http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,2034040,00.html" target="_blank">Time Magazine interview</a> in which he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;We can see the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu coming out with a very interesting statement that leaders should speak in public like they do in private whenever they can. He believes that the result of this publication, which makes the sentiments of many privately held beliefs public, are promising a pretty good [<em>indecipherable</em>] will lead to some kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in relation to Iran. I just noticed today Iran has agreed to nuclear talks. Maybe that&#8217;s coincidence or maybe it&#8217;s coming out of this process, but it&#8217;s certainly not being canceled by this process.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are so many things wrong with this it&#8217;s hard to know where to start.  First, Bibi Netanyahu should talk about saying the same thing in private that he says in public.  The problem with Israeli policy is that it says one thing in private and does the exact opposite (or pretty much whatever it wants) in public.  Take Meir Dagan&#8217;s promise to Bush&#8217;s national security advisor that Israel didn&#8217;t intend to attack Syria, made only two months before Israel took out an alleged nuclear reactor there.</p>
<p>Second, and as Cohen noted, Bibi is talking about Israel&#8217;s desire for war against Iran.  He wishes foreign leaders would back up their hostile words spoken privately to U.S. ears with public hostility toward Iran.  This would bring the Middle East closer to war, not peace.  So if you think a U.S. or Israeli attack on Iran will lead to some kind of &#8220;increase&#8221; in the peace process then you&#8217;re with Julian on this one (and belong in the loony bin).  But if you&#8217;re someone who has his head screwed on right, both Bibi and Julian are full of s(&amp;t on this one.</p>
<p>Which all goes to show you that even people who are doing the right thing may be doing it for the wrong reasons.  Or may have feet of clay.  Whistleblowers like Assange often have very complicated, and sometimes personal, or not very noble reasons for their actions.  At times, they don&#8217;t understand the magnitude of their actions and their long-term impact on themselves, their loved ones or their audience.  I know this from my own interaction with such a source.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 380px"><img class=" " title="joe lieberman" src="http://www.richardsilverstein.com/tikun_olam/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/joementum.jpg" alt="joe lieberman" width="370" height="248" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Joe &#39;I-Brought-Down-Wikileaks&#39; Lieberman, tin-pot senator</p></div>
<p>On a related note, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/world/03amazon.html?hpw" target="_blank">Amazon has caved in spectacular fashion</a> to Joe &#8220;Little Mussolini&#8221; Lieberman by yanking Wikileaks off the Amazon servers for supposed violation of terms of use.  So much for web hosts upholding freedom of speech and the free exchange of information on the internet.  What shocks me is Amazon&#8217;s explanation for its actions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon&#8230;said that it had canceled its relationship with WikiLeaks not because of “a government inquiry,” but because it decided that the organization was violating the terms of service for the program.</p>
<p>“When companies or people go about securing and storing large quantities of data that isn’t rightfully theirs, and publishing this data without ensuring it won’t injure others, it’s a violation of our terms of service, and folks need to go operate elsewhere,” the company said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Talk about speaking truthfully in public settings, Amazon is lying and doing so unconvincingly.  Of course they dumped Wikileaks because of a government inquiry and government pressure.  Of course they didn&#8217;t want to be on the wrong side of a Washington power-broker who could cause them no end of headaches.  What do you think that phone call from Joe Lieberman was?  An invitation to the dance?</p>
<p>We got mad at Google and Yahoo for acquiescing to Chinese censorship.  This isn&#8217;t that much different.  Someone in the government who can make your company&#8217;s life a living hell tells you to get rid of Wikileaks and instead of considering your options or corporate reputation if you cave, you promptly follow orders and dump &#8216;em.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s finding that Wikileaks doesn&#8217;t &#8220;own&#8221; the data or that is isn&#8217;t rightfully theirs is just plain wild.  On what basis are they saying the material isn&#8217;t rightfully theirs?  Isn&#8217;t that for a court to decide?  And what violation of law specifically has Wikileaks engaged in in receiving or storing the documents?  That hasn&#8217;t been proven either.  Yes, one could argue that Bradley Manning, the actual leaker violated military guidelines.  But Wikileaks?  That&#8217;s hard to tell without legal adjudication.</p>
<p>Besides, if Wikileaks violated Amazon&#8217;s terms of service by uploading this material to its server doesn&#8217;t every newspaper website which is featuring the same material risk violating the terms of service of their web hosts?  Should the NY Times&#8217; webhost take down its site for this reason?  Where do you draw the line?</p>
<p>At any rate, the bottom line is that Amazon is a spineless wimp which ought to recall the corporate slogan of another online corporate behemoth, Google: Do no evil.  Amazon, you&#8217;ve done bad today.  Very bad.  I hope you get so much nasty negative publicity from this that you live to regret your spinelessness.  At the first sign of trouble, you head for the hills.  Is this any way to stand up for free speech on the web?  To support those who speak truth to power?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a chance Julian Assange may be Time&#8217;s Person of the Year (note: I didn&#8217;t vote for him).  I hope if he is he takes a nice big pot shot at Amazon for caving to U.S. government bullies.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;d hoped that with the demise of the Bush administration we would leave the realm of Really Bad Ideas like the Patriot Act, Guantanamo, criminalizing free speech and being Muslim, etc.  Yes, I know that the Obama presidency has a pretty sordid record of maintaining some of the worst of these laws.  But until now, it hadn&#8217;t done much to add to the damage by creating <em>new </em>Really Bad Ideas.  Until <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/02/world/02legal.html?hpw" target="_blank">this report in today&#8217;s NY Times</a>, saying the government was contemplating charging Julian Assange with some form of espionage for releasing the hundreds of thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables which have so embarrassed our government.</p>
<p>I admit that if I were a senior government official, this development would be making me tear my hair out.  And I understand when human beings are deeply frustrated they contemplate doing really extreme things.  But not this, please not this.</p>
<p>Julian Assange may be a lot of things.  He may not be a pleasant person.  He may be self-righteous.  He may think he&#8217;s God&#8217;s gift to Man (and women).  But prosecuting him is a Really Bad Idea.  First, it will be almost impossible to win a conviction.  Second, it will turn him into even more of a martyr than he is now.  Third, it will turn the civil liberties community against Obama even more forcefully than it already is.  Fourth, it will motivate <a class="zem_slink" title="Wikileaks" rel="homepage" href="http://www.wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a> supporters and potential whistleblowers to dig even deeper and expose even more secrets.  This can only end badly for the government.</p>
<p>As to how difficult this prosecution would be: remember one of the last people charged under the 1917 espionage statute?  That would be Daniel Ellsberg.  That didn&#8217;t end so well for the government.  Nor did the prosecution of Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman under that same statute.</p>
<p>Whistleblowers like Assange, imperfect as they and their motivations may be, perform a benefit for society.  They cleanse the system.  They reveal secrets that often are better seen in the light of day.  These secrets allow us to understand our world better and be better citizens for it.  This is also true of Shammai Leibowitz, the Israeli-American who last spring began serving a federal prison sentence for leaking government secrets to a blogger.  Ellsberg invokes Shammai, <a class="zem_slink" title="Arrest of Bradley Manning" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_of_Bradley_Manning">Bradley Manning</a> and Julian Assange as courageous souls for puncturing the shroud of government secrecy.  That sounds about right.</p>
<p>So Pres. Obama and AG Holder&#8211;don&#8217;t make this Really Big Mistake, if you know what&#8217;s good for you.</p>

					<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 394px"><img class=" " title="alperon hit" src="http://www.richardsilverstein.com/tikun_olam/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/israelmafia.jpg" alt="alperon hit" width="384" height="286" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Alperon&#39;s car and body after bomb explosion</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve written here about as assassination and attempted assassination in Teheran a few days ago, which Haaretz&#8217; Yossi Melman attributes to the Mossad.  In these cases, the two scientists were driving in their cars to work with their wives.  They&#8217;d pulled into the university parking lot when a motorscooter pulled alongside and the driver threw a magnetic bomb at the driver side window, pulled away and then detonated his device.  In one case, the victim was killed; in the second, he was seriously injured.</p>
<p>Compare this account to the following from a May 15, 2009 <a href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2009/05/09TELAVIV1098.html" target="_blank">Wikileaks cable</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In November 2008&#8230;Yaakov Alperon was assassinated in broad daylight in a gruesome attack on the streets of xxxx, only about a mile away from the Embassy. According to several media accounts, <em>a motor scooter pulled up alongside Alperon&#8217;s car and the rider attached a sophisticated explosive device with a remote detonator to the car door. The bomb killed Alperon and his driver</em>, and injured two innocent pedestrians. The hit was the latest in a series of violent attacks and reprisals, and indicated a widening&#8230;war&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s the difference?  In the first case, criminality was used to pursue state policy.  In the second case, criminality was used in pursuit of the ends of Israeli organized crime.  In fact, the U.S. embassy cable includes this telling statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;The old school of Israel  OC [organized crime] is giving way to a new, more violent, breed of crime&#8230;The new style of crime features knowledge of hi-tech explosives acquired from service in the Israeli Defense Forces&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>This invokes one of the most profound insights of the film, M, that is, that the forces of the state and laws that govern them are sometimes no different than those of the criminals they pursue.  Where do we think Israeli criminals learn their &#8220;skills?&#8221;  In killing Palestinians of course while serving their nation.  These two passages prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that this experience is exploited for corrosive effect within Israeli society.  Bringing the Occupation back home with a vengeance.</p>
<p>The entire cable linked above is instructive reading in terms of educating one about the penetration of organized crime into many corners of Israeli life and world commerce.  One claim I find hard to believe is the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not entirely clear to what extent OC elements have penetrated the Israeli establishment and corrupted public officials. The INP [Israeli National Police] insists that such instances are rare, despite the occasional revelation of crooked police officers in the press.</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, the Israeli police are widely regarded by Israelis as corrupt, brutish and ineffective.  In some regard, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether organized crime <em>has </em>penetrated the ranks.  It might as well have considering how useless the cops are there.  Besides the<em> tour de force</em> blog post written by Eyal Clyne which documents scores of incidents of police mayhem as reported in the Israeli media, note that only<em> 41%</em> of Israelis have full or partial confidence in the police.  In a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/141512/congress-ranks-last-confidence-institutions.aspx" target="_blank">2009 Gallup poll</a>, 59% of Americans expressed full or partial confidence in their police.  Israeli is a country in which the rule of law is a concept but not a reality.  And a good part of the reason for this is the debilitating effect of the Occupation on every aspect of Israeli society.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Israeli media outlets like Haaretz are trumpeting the fact that the Wikileaks documents disclose multiple U.S. contacts with foreign leaders in which they urge the us to attack Iran&#8217;s nuclear program.  <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/wikileaks-exposed-all-on-iran-but-told-nothing-new-1.327495" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s a sampling</a> from Yossi Melman in Haaretz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WikiLeaks exposed all on Iran, but told nothing new</strong><br />
<em> In the modern age, covert documents aren&#8217;t necessarily as surprising and often state the obvious; in this case: Everyone wants Iran bombed.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s undoubtedly true that many nations did urge the U.S. to take action.  But what even U.S. diplomats note in the secret cables, is their frustration that figures like the Saudi king would not make such statements publicly and would not support U.S. action against Iran were it to happen.  So what you have is a case of the leaders and diplomats from these countries telling their U.S. interlocutors what they think they want to hear.  And even if we presume that these leaders <em>do </em>want the U.S. to attack, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and no nation except Israel wants to eat this pudding.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In essence, any country can say whatever it wants privately.  But what is said behind closed doors has very little impact in this type of situation.  If a leader is unwilling to support military action publicly, then his country is missing in action from the public debate and private support counts for nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Even more importantly, the above Haaretz headline is absolutely wrong because again, U.S. diplomats express their repeated frustration in these cables with the Russians and Chinese, and view them as being unreliable on the Iran issue.  No one can say by any stretch that Russia or China want Iran bombed (<strong>note</strong>: thanks reader for catching my earlier error).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So much for accuracy and not racing to conclusions.  Not so fast fellas.  Let&#8217;s stop the march to war in its footsteps with a bit of caution and due diligence.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sloppy journalism.</p>

					<p>A friend just pointed out to me <a href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2008/10/08STATE116392.html" target="_blank">something that sits in one of the U.S. diplomatic cables</a> clear as day and which I missed entirely.  There is an inordinate interest placed on Israel&#8217;s telecommunications systems by U.S. diplomats.  They are called upon to report back to Foggy Bottom about anything they learn inside Israel on that score.  Why?  Because the U.S. wants to do to Israel what Israel does to us: that is, snoop on everything from Congress to the White House.</p>
<p>It could also be said that the U.S. has interest in such matters because it wants to be better able to combat Israeli penetration of the U.S. (counter espionage).  Read the following information requested from U.S. diplomats stationed in Israel, with the above in mind:</p>
<blockquote><p>G. Information Infrastructure and Telecommunications Systems (INFR-3).</p>
<p>&#8211;Current specifications, vulnerabilities, capabilities, and planned upgrades to national telecommunications infrastructure, networks, and technologies used by government and military authorities, intelligence and security services, and the public sector.</p>
<p>&#8211;Details about command, control, and communications systems and facilities.</p>
<p>&#8211;National leadership use of and dependencies on a dedicated telecommunications infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8211;Details about national and regional telecommunications policies, programs, regulations, and training.</p>
<p>&#8211;Information about current and planned upgrades to public sector communications systems and technologies used by government, military personnel, and the civil sector, including cellular phone networks, mobile satellite phones, very small aperture terminals (VSAT), trunked and mobile radios, pagers, prepaid calling cards, firewalls, encryption, international connectivity, use of electronic data interchange, and cable and fiber networks.</p>
<p>&#8211;Information about wireless infrastructure, cellular communications capabilities and makes and models of cellular phones and their operating systems, to include second generation and third generation systems.</p>
<p>&#8211;Details about the use of satellites for telecommunication purposes, including planned system upgrades. &#8211;Details about internet and intranet use and infrastructure, including government oversight.</p>
<p>&#8211;Details about foreign and domestic telecommunications service providers and vendors.</p>
<p>&#8211;Plans and efforts to acquire US export-controlled telecommunications equipment and technology.</p>
<p>&#8211;Plans and efforts to export or transfer state-of-the art telecommunications equipment and technology.</p>
<p>&#8211;Details about information repositories associated with radio frequency identification (RFID)-enabled systems used for passports, government badges, and transportation systems.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the U.S. government began serially apologizing to various nations around the world, including Israel, about what was to come from the Wikileaks dump, I knew something juicy was in the offing.  And the materials don&#8217;t disappoint.  I&#8217;d say though, rather than providing lightning flash revelations, they merely deepen our understanding of how the relationship works and what these guys say behind closed doors.</p>
<p>Here are some fascinating memos.  <a href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2008/10/08STATE116392.html" target="_blank">This one dated October 31, 2008, in particular</a> is a bit of a jaw-dropper.  Usually, diplomats maintain a strict separation between their professional work and spying.  The CIA does the latter and diplomats concentrate on foreign policy matters.  Apparently, no longer.  A memo from the Rice-era State Department, which euphemistically notes that its contents call for assisting in compiling &#8220;biographical information&#8221; on Palestinians, calls for U.S. personnel to report credit card, frequent flier account numbers, and work schedule to their superiors in Washington:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><a id="par2" href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2008/10/08STATE116392.html#par2">¶</a>2. (S/NF) State biographic reporting - including on
Palestinians: 

<a id="parA" href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2008/10/08STATE116392.html#parA">¶</a>A.  (S/NF) The intelligence community relies on State
reporting officers for much of the biographical information
collected worldwide.  Informal biographic reporting via email
and other means is vital to the community's collection
efforts and can be sent to the INR/B (Biographic) office for
dissemination to the IC.  State reporting officers are
encouraged to report on noteworthy Palestinians as
information becomes available. 

<a id="parB" href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2008/10/08STATE116392.html#parB">¶</a>B.  (S/NF) When it is available, reporting officers should
include as much of the following information as possible:
office and organizational titles; names, position titles and
other information on business cards; numbers of telephones,
cell phones, pagers and faxes; compendia of contact
information, such as telephone directories (in compact disc
or electronic format if available) and e-mail listings;
internet and intranet "handles", internet e-mail addresses,
web site identification-URLs; <em>credit card account numbers;
frequent flyer account numbers; work schedules</em>, and other
relevant biographical information.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It also calls for reporting:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>--Details of travel plans such as routes and vehicles used by
Palestinian Authority leaders and HAMAS members.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s also rather shocking to find the U.S. concerned with, and seeking intelligence about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>--Information on illegal weapons transactions <em>with Israelis</em>.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And it&#8217;s no wonder that during the paranoid reign of Dick Cheney, the U.S. administration told its Middle East diplomats to watch out for this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>--Indications of interest by Palestinian terrorist groups in
the acquisition or use of chemical, biological, or nuclear
weapons...</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. government appears greatly concerned about Israel&#8217;s capabilities to beg, borrow or steal top-secret U.S. technology.  It asks diplomats to report on:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>--Plans and efforts to acquire US export-controlled
telecommunications equipment and technology.
--Plans and efforts to export or transfer state-of-the art
telecommunications equipment and technology.
--Details about information repositories associated with
radio frequency identification (RFID)-enabled systems used</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2009/02/09TELAVIV457.html" target="_blank">This February 26, 2009 account</a> of a meeting between Congress member Benjamin Cardin and Bibi Netanyahu after national elections but before he became prime minister, reveals the latter&#8217;s grandiosity concerning the &#8220;Iranian threat:&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Netanyahu described a nuclear Iran as the greatest threat facing Israel, and urged...a viable military option
to confront a problem that he said threatened the region and
<em>could prove a "tipping point" in world history</em>...
<pre>According to Netanyahu, if Iran develops a nuclear weapon
capability it will "topple the peace process" and "<em>change the
history of the world</em>."</pre>
<pre>Netanyahu complained that Iran's "tentacles" were choking Israel, and
that a new one grew back whenever one was cut off.  Netanyahu
charged that Iran was developing nuclear weapons with the
express purpose of wiping out Israel...</pre>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting too is this passage, in which Bibi confuses Christian evangelical millenialism with Persian Muslim theology about which he clearly knows nothing:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Netanyahu described the Iranian regime as crazy, retrograde,
and fanatical, with a <em>Messianic desire to speed up a violent
"end of days</em>."</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In the following passage, Bibi reveals his disdain for the concept, widely accepted in the international community, of a return to 1967 borders in exchange for peace.  Those who claim the Israeli PM accepts a two state solution should reconcile that belief with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>...According to Netanyahu - withdrawing to the 1967 borders...would "get
terror, not peace"</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is more about the sham peace that Bibi envisions offering the Palestinians:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Once the Palestinian Authority develops into a real partner it will be
possible to negotiate an agreement over territory,
settlements and "<em>refined" Palestinian sovereignty without an
army or control over air space and borders</em>.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>What he&#8217;s describing isn&#8217;t a country, but a Bantustan.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, in this portion of the memo, reveals that there is indirect trade between Israel and Iraq facilitated through Jordan.  Considering that Iraq supposedly has an ironclad ban on trade with Israel in place, if true, this claim is fascinating:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Pointing to what he described as strong
but unpublicized trade between Haifa port and Iraq via
Jordan, he suggested assembly points could be set up in the
West Bank for some goods, which would create thousands of
jobs.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It should also be noted that Israel had imported Iranian oil until recently despite Israel&#8217;s supposedly ironclad ban on such commerce.  All of this indicates the level of hypocrisy that accompanies solemn ideological pronouncements by leaders, whether in Tel Aviv or Baghdad.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2009/11/09TELAVIV2482.html" target="_blank">November 16, 2009 memo</a> concerning a high level meeting between U.S. diplomats and senior Israeli military-intelligence confirms that the IDF repeats the same nonsense in such private sessions as it does publicly:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Israeli officials explained that they were
going through an unprecedented period of calm due to the
deterrent effect of Operation CAST LEAD...</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And more nonsense from the defense ministry chief of military intelligence analysis (keep in mind we are now precisely one year from the date of this meeting):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<pre>General Baidatz argued that <em>it would take
Iran one year to obtain a nuclear weapon</em> and two and a half
years to build an arsenal of three weapons.</pre>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Amos Gilad, in this passage, shows the proper level of disingenuousness by actually claiming that Middle Eastern countries will clamor for their own nuclear weapons if Iran gets one, rather than from fear of Israel having one:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Amos Gilad explained his view of the repercussions of an Iranian nuclear
capability stating that it would give Iran a free hand in
supporting "HAMAStan" in Gaza and "Hezbollahstan" in Lebanon.
 Gilad also argued that Saudi Arabia would definitely react
to a nuclear Iran by obtaining a weapon (with Pakistani
assistance) and Egypt would almost certainly follow.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone will have to explain to me how Iran having a nuclear weapon will embolden its policies regarding Hezbollah and Hamas.  Would it threaten to use its bomb to support its proxies in these countries?  It just doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p>In this passage, the Israeli military brass argue that despite the undermining of the PA security apparatus that occurs when the IDF conducts anti-terror incursions in the West Bank, it must continue to do so&#8230;for the sake of Jordan!!  I kid you not:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>...They [the Israelis] stated that if Israel allowed a weak and untrained security
force to take over in the West Bank in the short term, <em>the
result will be deterioration of the Israel-Jordan
relationship</em> over the long term.  The prospect of poor
Israeli-Jordanian relations, according to Amos Gilad, is
unacceptable, and would result in the loss of "strategic
depth" for Israel.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>How ending Israeli disruption of Palestinian sovereignty in the West Bank would disrupt Israel&#8217;s relations with Jordan is a mystery beyond me.  The fact that a senior Israeli general would pose this nonsense in a meeting with high level American officials shows both Israel&#8217;s delusions and its disrespect for the intelligence of their U.S. interlocutors.</p>
<p>The following exchange shows that the Americans and Israeli are talking past each other, the former with naiveté and the latter with utter cynicism:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>He [assistant U.S. defense secretary] asked if Israel had made any headway in tems of an
information operations campaign to better communicate with
the people of Gaza.  Israeli officials offered very little in
the way of a communications strategy or long-term vision for
the territories, but reinforced Israel's core belief that
HAMAS has only sinister motives, and that any attempt Fatah
might make to improve its standing in Gaza would only be met
with HAMAS opposition...Ambassador
Vershbow sought further clarification on this point, querying
Israeli officials over the level of public support for HAMAS.
 Specifically, the ASD asked if there was any way to
undermine support for HAMAS vis-a-vis the peace process.
Amos Gilad responded simply by saying that one of Israel's
biggest concerns is the atmosphere created by disjointed
peace talks.  Specifically, Gilad stated that political
promises of peace, unification, and reconciliation --
concepts that are never realized -- are only resulting in a
climate of uncertainty that is unhealthy.  On this matter,
Gilad mentioned that Egypt's role in pushing reconciliation
is not helpful and often counterproductive</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. projects a pragmatic interest in combatting Hamas through a public diplomacy campaign, to which the Israelis say: why waste your time?  Israel clearly argues for continued Palestinian fragmentation and divisiveness as a policy goal, a losing long-term proposition if ever there was one.</p>
<p>In this exchange on the Goldstone Report, the Israeli MOD&#8217;s director general sells the Yanks a bill of goods.  Not sure how making 300,000 calls to Palestinians warning them to get out of Dodge constitutes an &#8220;extraordinary step to mitigate civilian casualties,&#8221; when inhabitants had either already abandoned their homes or could not do so due to the fact that the IDF shot virtually anything that moved on the streets:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>In bringing up the Goldstone Report, DG Buchris
emphasized that <em>the Government of Israel took extraordinary
steps to mitigate civilian casualties</em>, despite <em>HAMAS's
deliberate use of civilians as human shields</em>.  He stated that
the IDF made over 300,000 phone calls to alert civilians
before bombing legitimate military targets.  He also compared
Israeli operations in Gaza to U.S. operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan and stated that Israel would do whatever was
necessary to protect its population.  In response, ASD
Vershbow recalled U.S. support for Israel in handling of the
Goldstone report, and offered to share U.S. experience in
investigating incidents in Iraq and Afghanistan as the GOI
considered whether to conduct an additional investigation.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not clear whether Vershbow&#8217;s &#8220;offer&#8221; in the last sentence is one to help Israel avoid serious investigation of Cast Lead abuses (since U.S. investigations of our own abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan have failed miserably); or whether this constitutes what he believes is a serious offer to help Israel do the right thing.  If the latter, it&#8217;s a woefully naïve offer.</p>
<p>In this passage, Amos Gilad seems to be conjuring a total fiction:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Gilad also noted that Turkey wanted to improve its relationships with
Iran and asserted that <em>it had made some very aggressive plans
recently to support HAMAS</em>.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To give you a sense of how almost eager Israel appears to be to engage in a pre-emptive srike that would surely spark a war among Iran, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, read this warning levelled by the Israeli MOD&#8217;s chief intelligence analyst:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Israeli officials have major concerns over
developments within Hezbollah -- specifically, its
relationship with Syria and Iran.  General Baidatz spoke of
this relationship and drew attention to the existing supply
of Fateh-110 long-range missile that Iran sent to Syria.
Israeli officials believe these missiles are destined for
Hezbollah.  According to Baidatz and others, if the delivery
were to occur, this would significantly alter Israel's
calculus.  Under such a scenario, the looming question for
Israeli policymakers then becomes: "<em>to strike or not to
strike</em>."</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, a top Israeli intelligence analyst is warning the Americans that if Syria supplies a particular rocket to Hezbollah the IDF would pre-emptively attack Hezbollah and in doing so likely spark major hostilities.</p>
<p>In a different meeting of the same individuals as above, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/235361" target="_blank">Amos Gilad again makes a claim</a> I&#8217;ve never heard before:</p>
<blockquote><p>He noted that rockets from Lebanon can now cover <em>the entire territory of Israel</em>&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d like to know on what basis he makes this claim.  And even if true, you&#8217;d think it might make Israel MORE eager to negotiate a settlement with Syria, Hezbollah&#8217;s sponsor.  This appears not to be the case as Israel prefers to complain to the Americans about the military threats it faces from its enemies while doing nothing to resolve the disputes themselves.</p>
<p>This colloquy reveals that high-level Israeli officials are not above lying outright to their American interlocutors:</p>
<blockquote><p>[U.S. diplomat Tom] Goldberger&#8230;questioned whether more commercial and humanitarian goods could be allowed through the Gaza border crossings. Gilad strongly stated that <em>there were no limits on commercial goods through the border crossings</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is such a bald-faced lie that one wonders whether the notetaker at the meeting misunderstood something.  Can Gilad really believe anyone would fall for such bulls(&amp;t?</p>
<p>In <a href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2009/11/09TELAVIV2500.html" target="_blank">this memo dated November 18, 2009</a>, IDF officers (including Amos Gilad) and ministry of defense senior officials (including the director general of the ministry) ask for a waiver that would allow Israelis with dual-citizenship to have the same access to sensitive U.S. military technology that a U.S. citizen would have.  As you read this, think of <a href="http://www.nemw.net/articles/2009sept/IsraelStillHasSpiesintheUS.html" target="_blank">Jonathan Pollard, Ben Ami Kadish and any number of other Israeli spies</a> who had/ve dual citizenship:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Dual Citizenship Issues
----------------------- 

<a id="par9" href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2009/11/09TELAVIV2500.html#par9">¶</a>9. (S) The GOI raised the issue of dual citizenship within
the context of access to sensitive technology.  U.S.
participants acknowledged Israeli concerns, noting that the
issue is being worked at the highest levels of the USG to
reach consensus on how to proceed.  <em>The GOI recommended
obtaining a waiver similar to the relationship from which
Canada or Australia benefit</em>.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>No telling what sorts of mischief this waiver would allow.  What&#8217;s most <em>chutzpadik</em> is the notion that Israel should be treated to the same waiver that Canadian and Australian dual-citizens receive, as if Israel has as close and friendly relations with the U.S. as those countries.  Don&#8217;t forget that the U.S. Justice Department ranks Israel third among foreign nations in terms of the intensity of its espionage operations in the U.S.</p>
<p>Regarding worsening relations between Israel and Turkey, six months before the Mavi Marmara fiasco Israel was noticing Turkey wasn&#8217;t returning the love:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Turkey
------ 

<a id="par10" href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2009/11/09TELAVIV2500.html#par10">¶</a>10. (S) The GOI raised the current direction the Government
of Turkey has taken toward Syria and Iran -- and away from
Israel.  Israeli participants argued that Turkey has been
supportive of Hamas in Gaza while pursuing a more "Islamic"
direction with the goal of becoming a regional superpower.
The GOI argued that the Turkish military is losing its
ability to influence government decisions and strategic
direction.  After this past year, GOI participants said they
have a "bad feeling" about Turkey.  The GOI noted that the
Israel Air Force (IAF) Commander in the past wanted to speak
to the Turkish Air Force Commander, but his Turkish
counterpart declined.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>One wonders, given Israel&#8217;s awareness of the deterioration of relations (&#8220;they have a &#8216;bad feeling&#8217;&#8221;) why it didn&#8217;t act more cautiously in its attack on the Mavi Marmara.  Did it, by then, not give a crap about relations with Turkey believing they were a lost cause anyway?  Or did someone in the Israeli navy f&amp;*k up big-time and not realize what a disaster was in store given the means they chose to subdue the relief ship?</p>
<p>As noted above, the Israeli are not above dissimulation in their attempts to blow smoke up the U.S.&#8217; read end.  A mere two months (the memo is dated July 26, 2007) before Israel attacked Syria&#8217;s alleged nuclear reactor (an act of aggression which the Syrian&#8217;s did not respond to), <a href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2007/07/07TELAVIV2280.html" target="_blank">Dagan lies directly to the face of a Bush&#8217;s Homeland Security advisor</a> in this meeting:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Dagan echoed other reports that Syria expects an
Israeli attack this summer, and has raised its level of
readiness.  Despite the fact that <em>Israel has no intention of
attacking</em>, said Dagan, the <em>Syrians are likely to retaliate
over even the smallest incident</em>, which could lead to quick
escalation.</pre>
