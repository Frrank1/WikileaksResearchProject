When a communication arrives from Tor, you can never know where or whom it’s from. Tor is by design not a media project or a human rights one or (anymore) a military one.

Jacob Appelbaum, a developer for Tor who travels the world explaining Tor to human rights and social-justice activists, tells me that users periodically complain about the politics and motivations of other (self-identified) users. What they don’t grasp is that if Tor were cohesive — physically or ideologically — its members could be identified. As Appelbaum explained, “If it’s only the military using the Tor network” — say — “it’s not anonymous.”

A Tor transmission these days might start in Addis Ababa, hop to Dallas, then to Stockholm and finally Johannesburg. (There are some 2,000 Tor relay nodes at any one time across the globe.) The only thing the Johannesburg recipient can discover is that the data came from Tor, and Tor has successfully identified itself with no person or group, only with ideological incoherence. For the person trying to get a message out through Tor,",Personal
